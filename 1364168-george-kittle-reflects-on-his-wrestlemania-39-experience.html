When asked about getting physically involved with <a href=#>The Miz</a> at <a href=#>WrestleMania 39</a> during his match with <a href=#>Pat McAfee</a>, Kittle said McAfee asked him for help ahead of time and was ready to be there if he needed him.</p><p>“Well, I mean, it was a wonderful experience. WWE is one of the coolest companies I’ve ever done anything with. Their hospitality is above and beyond; they just treat everybody so well,” George Kittle said. “The shows they put on are amazing. WrestleMania is one of the coolest experiences; if you’ve never been to WrestleMania if you don’t even watch wrestling, WrestleMania is an incredible experience. You got to do it at least once; it’s nuts. So that part was awesome.</p><p>“Me and Pat talked a little bit yesterday; I’ve been pestering him for a while about wanting to get in the ring. Help them out if he needed anything, just letting him know that hey, I have your back. If anything happens and he shot me a text last week that said, ‘Hey, I might need your WrestleMania. I might not; I’m not sure; just be ready.’</p><p>“So I’ve been wearing that black tank top you’re about to see for about two weeks just in preparation. Just in case something happened in the middle of the day workout-wise, and then I had my opportunity because The Miz decided to mouth off. Thought he was tough enough to push me out of my chair. My wife said, ‘Hey, go in there and kick his ass,’ and I’m not gonna let my wife down, so I had to go on there and back up my guy Pat.”</p><p><a href=#>Pat McAfee Returns At WrestleMania 39, George Kittle Helps Him Beat The Miz</a></p><p>What do you make of George Kittle’s comments?
