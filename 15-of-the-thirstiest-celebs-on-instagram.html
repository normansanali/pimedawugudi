In the following article, the term "thirst" applies to female celebs who are desperately seeking likes and comments of praise from the world of social media by posting very sexual pics. The bottom line is that the number of followers a celeb has on Instagram can lead to very lucrative checks and endorsement deals from big brands looking to gain publicity for their products. It's also a great way for music artists or actresses to spread the word about a new album/film they are involved in. We have compiled 15 of these "thirst trap"&nbsp;celebs&nbsp;below. Some of them are on the extreme end of the spectrum (Miley Cyrus, Kim K), and there are others who set a thirst trap on a more sporadic basis (Serena Williams). Take a look and enjoy all the lustful skin on display ...</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong></h2><p>via:www.brobible.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to thirst traps on the internet, it really doesn’t get more provocative than <a title="Nicki Minaj Net Worth" href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>. She knows she has a voluptuous body with the&nbsp;curves that many men desire, and she’s not afraid to flaunt them. Especially for the lead up to her 2014 album The Pinkprint, she released tons of sexy pics on her IG page to really get the buzz going. We have a feeling her thirst trapping behavior will continue well into 2015.</p><p></p><h2 id=amber-rose><strong>Amber Rose</strong></h2><p>via:www.popsugar.com</p><p><a title="Amber Rose Net Worth" href=#>Amber Rose</a> seems to be on the prowl in 2015. If there’s one thing we know about this former stripper, it’s that that she definitely knows how to pick them. Her first suitor in the rap world was <a title="Kanye West Net Worth" href=#>Kanye West</a>, and then she moved on to <a title="Wiz Khalifa Net Worth" href=#>Wiz Khalifa</a> and actually married him. But sadly, that union ended last year. Since the beginning of this new year, she has been setting all kinds of thirst traps on the internet. Looks like she’s ready to find a new man!</p><p></p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p>via:www.nydailynews.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wouldn’t be a stretch at all to call the majority of <a title="Miley Cyrus Net Worth" href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>’s career to date one huge thirst trap. It seems that her main strategy is to shock and awe the general public as much as possible. And you know what, that strategy is definitely working. She has over 14 million followers on Instagram and that number keeps growing. From nearly naked pics to ones that feature her touching herself, this girl has no boundaries. One can only&nbsp;imagine what kind of pictures she will&nbsp;post this year.</p><p></p><h2 id=ashanti><strong>Ashanti</strong></h2><p>via:www.nydailynews.com</p><p>At the beginning of her career in the early 2000’s, <a title="Ashanti Net Worth" href=#>Ashanti</a> was one of the hottest stars on the urban music scene. She was the princess of the Murder Inc. music label which was run by Irv Gotti and <a title="Ja Rule Net Worth" href=#>Ja Rule</a>. She came out the door with several hits like “Foolish” and “What’s Luv,” but as the years have gone by, her popularity has diminished. She’s currently 34-yrs-old and still making music, but it seems like she gets the most feedback from her fans when she posts her sexy thirst trap images on her IG page.</p><p></p><h2 id=aubrey-o-day><strong>Aubrey O’Day</strong></h2><p>via:www.nydailynews.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simply put, <a title="Aubrey O’Day Net Worth" href=#>Aubrey O’Day</a> is the definition of a bona fide thirst trap. She hasn’t put an album out that anyone has cared about in such a long time, so the only way to really keep herself in the news is by flaunting her sexy body. The interesting thing about her career is that there are still so many loyal fans out there for her former group Danity Kane. But considering&nbsp;their last attempt at a reunion ended up in a violent outbreak between Dawn Robinson and Aubrey, it doesn’t look like the group will ever get back together.</p><p></p><h2 id=beyonce><strong>Beyonce</strong></h2><p>via:rtunoticias.com</p><p>It may seem a little disrespectful to call <a title="Beyonce Net Worth" href=#>Queen B</a> a thirst trap, but we have to call it like we see it. The fact is that Beyonce is an extremely savvy and ambitious entertainer and entrepreneur. She knows that in addition to making amazing music and having the best live performances, it’s also extremely important to have a sexy image to sell to the masses. So if that means setting a thirst trap every now and then, so be it.</p><p></p><h2 id=iggy-azalea><strong>Iggy Azalea</strong></h2><p>via: www.youtube.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rapper <a title="Iggy Azalea Net Worth" href=#>Iggy Azalea</a> had an extremely successful 2014, and she’s making a sweep in several categories at the various award shows happening right now. She’s also up for several new awards at the upcoming Grammy’s, and it will be interesting to see if she takes those home too. As far as thirst trapping goes, Iggy is not shy to flaunt her attractive Australian curves for all the men to gawk at. We are pretty sure that a large portion of fans who bought her album The New Classic are guys who would love to spend a sensual evening with her.</p><p></p><h2 id=serena-williams><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Serena Williams</strong></h2><p>via:www.voice.fi</p><p>The unstoppable Tennis powerhouse <a title="Serena Williams Net Worth" href=#>Serena Williams</a> will undoubtedly go down as one of the most iconic tennis players of all time. At the age of 33, she probably still has a few more years of hard court domination in her future. When it comes to her physique, she is sculpted like a granite statue, and when she’s not defeating competitors in her matches, she’s not averse to posting some suggestive pics of herself on her Instagram page. Thirst traps come in all different shapes and varieties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=draya><strong>Draya</strong></h2><p>via:community.allhiphop.com</p><p>Draya Michele is one of those reality TV stars that viewers can’t seem to get enough of. She stars on the popular VH1 series Basketball Wives, and she is one of the most vocal and outspoken personalities on the show. In her personal life, she has been linked romantically to music stars and pro-athletes like DeShawn Stevenson and <a title="Chris Brown Net Worth" href=#>Chris Brown</a>. Draya’s Instagram page is full of some really seductive, thirst trapping pics and she also takes a lot of sexy shots to promote her clothing brand, Fine A$s Girls.</p><p></p><h2 id=teyana-taylor><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Teyana Taylor</strong></h2><p>via:hypelifemagazine.com</p><p>The 24-yr-old singer <a title="Teyana Taylor Net Worth" href=#>Teyana Taylor</a> is signed to Kanye West’s GOOD MUSIC label, and for the last several years she has been trying really hard to make a name for herself on the music scene. She’s definitely a talented performer, but it looks like she hasn’t quite locked into to her lane yet. In the meantime, one thing she does love to do is show off her bangin’ body on IG. She obviously puts in a lot of time at the gym for such a rock hard body, so she obviously wants the whole world to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=christina-milian><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Christina Milian</strong></h2><p>via;www.tvnoviny.sk</p><p>She may not be as “out there” as some of the other ladies on this list, but pop/R&B singer <a title="Christina Milian Net Worth" href=#>Christina Milian</a> is no stranger to flaunting her good looks to get both the guys and girls talking on Instagram.&nbsp; It looks like this year she’s really out to make a splash on the scene. She has a new reality show on E! and she’s apparently back in the studio recording new music too. Her last big hit was in 2009, so she has a lot of catching up to do.</p><p></p><h2 id=kylie-jenner><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></h2><p>via;www.nydailynews.com</p><p>She might be only 17-yrs-old but the younger <a title="Kylie Jenner Net Worth" href=#>Jenner&nbsp;sister</a> is already extremely well-versed in the dark arts of generating “thirst trap” buzz on social media. One would logically ask where her parents are when she’s getting involved in these activities, but then you remember that her mom & dad are <a title="Kris Jenner Net Worth" href=#>Kris</a> and <a title="Bruce Jenner Net Worth" href=#>Bruce Jenner</a>. There are probably no rules of decorum at all in her home. There were even rumors swirling recently that she was pregnant with a child by the rapper, <a title="Tyga Net Worth" href=#>Tyga</a>, but that hasn’t been confirmed either. It will be interesting to see what kind of young adult she develops into.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=jhene-aiko><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Jhene Aiko</strong></h2><p>via:djsdoingwork.tumblr.com</p><p>The 26-yr-old, pint-sized singer, Jhene Aiko, has been one of the breakthrough stars on the R&B/neo-soul scene in the last few years. She has featured on tracks with some of the biggest stars on the scene today, and she has even been romantically linked to rappers like Childish Gambino and <a title="Drake Net Worth" href=#>Drake</a>. Overall, she has a pretty clean image. But every now and then, she sets a thirst trap or two on her IG page to show her fans that she’s still a very sexual person.</p><p></p><h2 id=rosa-acosta><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Rosa Acosta</strong></h2><p>via:grindtimenow.net</p><p>Rosa Acosta calls herself a ballet dancer, personal trainer and future chef on her Instagram page, but most people know her for being a video vixen in rap videos for stars like Diddy, Pitbull and Mario. When you head to her Instagram page, there are tons of shots of her exposing her curves and engaging in all kinds of provocative poses. Perhaps she’s just advertising what she can do if you hire her for her personal training services. Or the other possibility is that she’s just being a very prolific thirst trap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p>via:www.nydailynews.com</p><p>Let’s just be honest and admit it; <a title="Kim Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> can pretty much be described as the Queen of the thirst trap celebs. She has pretty much made a career of flaunting her flawless face and sexy curves to earn herself millions of dollars. She even has a book coming out this year called Selfish that compiles some of her best and sexiest selfies to date. You must admit, Kim K has this fame game down to a precise and very lucrative science.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqbV2ks27Ax55kraCZp8C1tcSsq2ablaGyo7%2BMqKVmoZ6owaKz0ZqkaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wynfrey-crews-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-53285-html.html><span>←</span><span>Wynfrey Crews Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
