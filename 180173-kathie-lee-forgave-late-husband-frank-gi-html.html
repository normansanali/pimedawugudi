Kathie was part of the show for 15 years, between 1985 and 2000.</p><p class=dh>Apart from that, she worked on the fourth hour of the “Today” show for 11 years, between 2008 and 2019. Throughout her time in both shows, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0317537/awards?ref_=nm_ql_2">received</a> 11 Daytime Emmy nominations and won the first one in 2010 when she was with the “Today” team.</p><p class=dh>As per her romantic life, she was married to Christian musician <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/kathie-lee-gifford-son-cody-engaged/>Paul Johnson</a> from 1976 to 1982. Although Kathie initially thought that Paul was the “ultimate Christian catch,” she soon learned that the truth was different.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Her relationship with Paul Johnson</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>In her book “<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.amazon.com/CANT-BELIEVE-SAID-THAT/dp/067174240X?tag=amomama07-20">I Can’t Believe I Said That!</a>”, the singer revealed that even on their wedding night in Acapulco, the couple could not get relaxed with each other. She also labeled her marriage as a “disappointment” for both of them.</p><p class=dh>Although things were uncomfortable from the very beginning, they were supposed to be married for life, so they stayed in their “illusion,” as Kathie described it, for six years before they eventually decided to part ways.</p><p class=dh>The singer found love again in the professional football player and TV sports commentator <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/08/09/when-frank-met-kathie-lee-the-story-of-the-giffords-marriage/?utm_term=.cf85761d8e8f">Frank Gifford</a>. They tied the knot in October 1986 and stayed together until he passed away in 2015.</p><p class=dh>When their romance hit the spotlight, the aspect that surprised people the most was their huge age gap.

However, we will get through this together. We ask that our privacy be respected at this difficult time.”</p><p class=dh>Although it was challenging and, according to Kathie, it was “a tremendous test of your relationship,” she forgave him.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Kathie eventually moved on</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>The TV personality <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://nypost.com/2000/03/09/she-trysts-frank-again-kathie-lee-lots-of-sex-is-best-relationship-mender/>admitted</a> that there was no such thing as a “magic formula” to forgive Frank. She pointed out that the couple stayed home and in bed, which is the “best thing” when a person “truly asked forgiveness."</p><p class=dh>Apart from that, their two children, Cody and Cassidy, were crucial elements in Kathie’s decision.
