Her parents are well-accomplished actors who have worked with some of Hollywood's best directors and producers. Her father, Topher Grace, is well known for playing Eric Forman in "That '70s Show."</p><p class=dh>Her mother is an actress more recently recognized for her role in Crackle's TV series, "StartUp." Mabel's parents are very private people who have concealed their children's identities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f384d3af676263670871f7dfe0d08166.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Ashley Grace and Topher Grace arrive at The Art Of Elysium's 13th Annual Celebration at Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles, CA, on January 04, 2020. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Mabel Jane Grace Gave Her Dad the Gift of Fatherhood</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>A simple day out, grabbing something to eat, turned into a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.eonline.com/news/867394/topher-grace-and-wife-ashley-hinshaw-expecting-their-first-child>paparazzi fest</a> for Topher and Ashley. The "About Cherry" star was seen in a blue and white striped dress with a tight fit that exposed the silhouette of her baby bump. Her husband took it easy in a pair of denim and a blue T-shirt.</p><p class=dh>They prefer keeping their personal experiences private, but there was no control over breaking such news that day. They were just over a year into marriage at the time of this discovery. Without any children, this pregnancy was a new experience for both of them, although Topher is the godfather of Jaime King's son.</p><p class=dh>The news had already hit the media when Ashley took to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BXQvto-hfYa/>Instagram</a> to make the announcement herself. She posted a photo of herself with a caption that revealed she had been pregnant for six and a half months. They managed to conceal it for most of the pregnancy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/90b7065fd27c2b3e55a7b317825b2513.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Ashley Hinshaw and Topher Grace at the 25th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, CA, on January 27, 2019. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Ashley hosted a baby shower and shared pictures of the event on Instagram on October 22. She credited Vanessa Felice for putting the event together and entertaining her guests.</p><p class=dh>On November 1, 2017, Topher and Ashley <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/893499/topher-grace-and-ashley-hinshaw-welcome-baby-girl-mabel-jane>welcomed their baby girl</a>, Mabel Jane Grace. Ashley was 28 years old then, and her husband of a year and a half was 39.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Mabel Jane Grace's Birth Helped Her Dad Find Purpose in His Role in "BlacKkKlansman"</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Mabel was born when her father was preparing for a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/topher-graces-newborn-daughter-gave-role-blackkklansman-purpose-162348554.html>Spike Lee film</a> to create awareness of the racial ills that have preceded the world as we know it. Topher suffered a lot while preparing for his role as the Klu Klux Klan grand Wizard, David Duke, who, upon researching, invoked feelings of depression.</p><p class=dh>The actor struggled with learning his lines from the film with a plot based in 1970 Colorado. With such a sensitive theme in the movie, Mabel's father had to memorize some truly hateful words, much to his wife's displeasure. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/topher-graces-newborn-daughter-gave-role-blackkklansman-purpose-162348554.html>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'd be rehearsing lines, and [my wife] would be like, 'Hey, can you like chill out with the hate speech right now? Our daughter's two weeks old.'"</p><p class=dh>Luckily for Topher, he was a father to a baby girl that brought him a lot of joy. He feels that actors are just playing pretend for a living, but with a topic like this and the birth of his little one, he found purpose in shooting this film and found it to be a cathartic experience.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Mabel Jane Grace Lives in Obscurity, but Her Sibling's Name Is Also a Mystery</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Mabel's parents have managed to keep her private and out of the public eye. However, in 2020, she<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/topher-grace-ashley-hinshaw-welcome-their-2nd-child/> became an older sibling</a> to a child who remains a complete mystery to the public. Mabel's parents have not disclosed any details about her younger sibling; not even the child's gender.</p><p class=dh>When she was pregnant with her second child, Ashley spoke about her excitement of becoming a mother of two, and months into her pregnancy showed off her beautiful baby bump. A misleading build-up for fans who anticipated a reveal.</p><p class=dh>When Ashley was in the hospital recovery room <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2022/09/30/topher-grace-and-wife-ashley-hinshaw-expecting-third-baby/>after their second child</a>, she felt it was okay for Topher to leave as it was not her first experience. However, he stuck around until she recovered. The "That 70's Show" star mentioned that he was excited about baby number two and looking forward to getting even less sleep.</p><p class=dh>In 2022, Ashley is pregnant with the third edition of their family, Topher shared on <a class="me a" href=#>Kelly Clarkson's</a> "The Kelly Clarkson Show." While on the show, Topher saw that announcement as the perfect opportunity to send his appreciation to his wife; he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2022/09/30/topher-grace-and-wife-ashley-hinshaw-expecting-third-baby/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"And I'd like to take this moment on national TV to say how beautiful and amazing she is."</p><p class=dh>Ashley is against the oppression of women and their right to plan their pregnancies. She shared a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CfMsYxjv8Fh/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">post on Instagram</a> expressing her support for women's rights. A portion of the caption details that she's been on the board of a foster care organization for the past three years.</p><p class=dh>Although the couple lives a better life, they do not keep their children a secret. It is public knowledge that they are parents of two, and the third is on the way. Ashley even expands on her history, detailing that she has been pregnant five times before and only given birth twice.</p><p class=dh>The sensitive details that she expresses are very personal to her, and she drives that energy into <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cdi7y8ulFZo/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">her activism</a> for other women's birth rights. With their family blossoming and careers peaking simultaneously, there is much to expect from the Graces.</p><p class=dh>Recently we took a deep dive into the facts about Topher's "BlaKkKlansman" counterpart, <a class="me a" href=#>Adam Driver's</a> relationship with his wife Joanne Tucker. Just like the Graces', they keep their relationship relatively private.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcm1gbXqurcGeo2aikaOybrPRmpqeZZmoeq%2B702amp6SpYrCptcudZLKdpGK1b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-szohr-aaron-rodgers-dating-again-after-2011-split-201432.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Szohr, Aaron Rodgers Dating Again: Actress, NFL Hunk Back On</span></a>
