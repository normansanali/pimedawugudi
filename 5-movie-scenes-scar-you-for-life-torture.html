Why? Because throughout most of the film, none of us saw this coming. You slowly come to realize the female character here is not right (the “bag scene” being a big indicator of this), but it all culminates at the end of the movie, when you realize that some really bad things are about to go down.</p><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>So, what goes down?
