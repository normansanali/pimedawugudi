The way she conveys herself in her lyrics, music videos, and on social media is avant-garde, but also normal in today's society. Many want to leave her behind in 2023, but that is not going to happen. Red is here to stay, especially after how successful she was throughout the year. 2024 is off to an exciting start for her personally. She can now officially say she is a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">mother of two children</a>. Sexyy Red's pregnancy has been a trending topic online over the past 24 hours and it is because of her new photo dump.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Missouri MC has <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">been pregnant</a> since she went on tour with Moneybagg Yo back in the summer of 2023. However, she did not announce she was carrying a child until October. Sexyy Red was doing her best to keep it under wraps, but it was just too much and she was "tired of fakin." To help celebrate the birth of her newborn, Red posted some interesting photos.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sexyy-red-s-pregnancy-is-what-we-would-expect-it-to-be>Sexyy Red's Pregnancy Is What We Would Expect It To Be</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the collage above, Sexyy Red is doing some daring poses of her rear and front end in her pregnancy gown. One of them even had to be covered up with a star emoji. Fans were making jokes about how fast her pregnancy was, but also in disgust of how she was behaving at the hospital. One person writes, "this is so embarrassing you a grown woman be serious for once." Another adds, "so sad to see & shawties praise this s***." This one even went as far as to say, "<br>these is some trifling a** picsüò≠üò≠üò≠" Regardless of the reactions, we are happy to see Red doing well post-pregnancy.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on Sexyy Red's post-pregnancy photos?
