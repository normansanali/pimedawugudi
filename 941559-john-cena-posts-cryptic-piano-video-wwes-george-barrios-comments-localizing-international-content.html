So we had to manage how much we were going to invest. We knew that there were a lot of folks outside the U.S. who would still subscribe even though it’s a U.S. product. We’ve got about 400,000 subscribers outside the U.S. even though it’s a U.S. product. It’s this decision around managing priorities and investment. We’re going to localize–it’s just a matter of when.”</p><p>“Localization isn’t just voicing over or subtitling content around the world. Our storytelling over the decades, it’s become more nuanced. Maybe 30 years ago, not a lot of nuance. As the percentage of international talent in that pipeline gets bigger and bigger, I think [having more nuanced talent becomes] organic. When you infuse that many cultures from around the world, I really do believe it’ll happen naturally. It will be less about us having to write it. The characters and the personalities evolve onto themselves.”</p><h2>John Cena’s Piano</h2><p>John Cena posted the following video of himself playing The Animals’ “House Of The Rising Sun” earlier today:</p><p><a class=listed-post-item-title href=# rel=noopener>The Undertaker Returns At Wrestlemania 34 To Answer John Cena’s Challenge (Photos / Video)</a></p><p class=authors-note>I’m sure this has something to do with ‘rising again’ after defeat, but Cena did recently say &nbsp;so he could learn to play a musical instrument. Pretty good skills either way!
