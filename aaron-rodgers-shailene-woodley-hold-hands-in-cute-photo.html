Woodley had her hair in a half-up, half-down topknot and wore a big, grey coat while standing next to the cooking staff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Aaron-Rodgers-and-Fiancee-Shailene-Woodley-Hold-Hands-in-Arkansas.jpg><p>The <a href=#>lovebirds both had big grins on their faces</a> as they interlocked their fingers and held hands after eating at the Arkansas eatery, which is located at the <a href=#>Best Court boutique hotel</a> in Hot Springs National Park.</p><p>“It was a private luncheon on Monday, March 29 that was arranged beforehand,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly. “The Executive Chef <strong>Joshua Egarland</strong> prepared the meal for Aaron, Shailene and their team.” The insider added: “Shailene and Aaron were affectionate with each other and holding hands. Everyone had a great time.”</p><p>One day prior, the couple were <a href=#>spotted together for the first time since announcing their engagement</a> in February. They were photographed boarding a private jet from Costa Careyes, Mexico, on Monday in casual attire.</p><p>Us&nbsp;reported in February that the athlete and the <a href=#>Big Little Lies</a> alum <a href=#>were dating after they were seen together</a> by sports blog <strong>Terez Owens</strong> in July 2020. “They started off as friends, but things have turned romantic,” a source told Us confirming their romance in February.</p><p>The same month, Rodgers <a href=#>revealed that he was secretly engaged</a> while accepting the AP Most Valuable Player award at the NFL Honors awards show, giving a shout-out to his “fiancée.” The football star didn’t say Woodley’s name, but he did announce, “I got engaged and played some of the best football of my career,” when speaking about the 2020 season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Aaron-Rodgers-Fiancee-Shailene-Woodley-Hold-Hands-Smile-Arkansas-002.jpg><p>The Divergent actress <a href=#>confirmed that she had been engaged to Rodgers “for a while”</a> during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on February 22.</p><p>“I never thought I’d be engaged to somebody who threw balls,” she said of her fiancé. “He’s, first off, just a wonderful, incredible human being. We met during this whacky, whacky time and all the stadiums were closed that he was playing in, so I have yet to go to a football game. I didn’t really grow up with sports, especially American sports. It was never really on my radar.”</p><p>Earlier this month the quarterback gushed over Woodley, telling Zenith Watches’ CEP <strong>Julien Tornare </strong>that “there’s been a lot of good” in his life recently, but <a href=#>his engagement to the actress has been the shining moment</a>.</p><p>“Obviously, that’s the best thing that’s happened to me in the last year,” he said during an Instagram Live interview at the time.</p><p>Rodgers, who <a href=#>previously dated <strong>Danica Patrick</strong></a> from December 2017 to <a href=#>July 2020</a> and<a href=#><strong> Olivia Munn </strong></a>from <a href=#>May 2014 to April 2017</a>, also revealed that he is excited to become a parent soon.</p><p>“I think the next great challenge will be being a father,” he said. “Maybe not in the immediate future, but definitely something I look forward to.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Woodley, for her part, was linked to <a href=#><strong>Ben Volavola</strong></a> in 2017 before calling it quits in April 2020.</p><p><strong>For more hot celebrity news, listen to Us Weekly editors dish on top topics & trends with these clips from the Hot Hollywood Podcast!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaamaKku26%2Bzp2enqqjYsCprcilnKedXay8sLDLnrBmoJ%2BhsW60wKebrGWZo3qkwdOeZKmgn6m8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anders-reyn-ribeiro.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Alfonso Ribeiros Wife Angela Unkrich?
