Although Rose filed for divorce from the “See You Again” rapper, 28, after 14 months of marriage (she cited irreconcilable differences), the pair have settled their differences and are closer than ever.</p><p>"It's so crazy that we are literally the best of friends," Rose revealed. "We hang out all the time. We have full family days with the baby."</p><p>"We just went out to a strip club the other night together — without the baby. Just me and Wiz," she added. "We just had a great f–king time. We spent like [$30,000] on strippers. It was sick. It was so cool."</p><p>Although the <i>Real Housewives of New York City</i> star suggested that Rose might one day rekindle her romance with Khalifa, the <i>How to Be a Bad Bitch</i> author doesn’t want to rush back into anything.</p><p>"I just feel like right now he should go be a ho for a while and work on his businesses, and then maybe later we can get back," she responded. "If God wants us together, we will be together."</p><span class=caption></span><p>Most recently, the “Slut Walk” founder has been linked to Toronto Raptors basketball player <b>Terrence Ross</b>. Prior to that, she famously dated <b>Kanye West </b>from 2009 until 2010.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav26%2BzqycZqeeYrqivtGimKCdXaK2tMDApJxmr5mptW6x12afrquSlruledaisWajmJa5qrLAZq5raWFngHJ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-nunes-and-nina-nunes-new-born-kid.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Nunes and Nina Nunes: New born Kid, Wife, &amp;amp; More</span></a>
