As soon as babysitting begins, however, Archer finds himself having to babysit another person: a rogue special agent from Pakistan. Over at HQ, the rest of the crew is having a hate-crime-filled poker night, complete with Breaking Bad costumes, potato chips, and alcohol (but seriously lacking in Milton). Oh, and apparently Woodhouse is on vacation.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-505463cf579754159f40830f65cfb241-4-0-0@published data-word-count=50><strong>The Highlight Reel</strong><br>At the beginning of the episode — and also for the rest of eternity, probably — Lana is skeptical of Archer’s babysitting and/or fathering capabilities, because she knows he has guns and booze stashed all over his apartment. But Archer really wants to prove himself in this episode:</p><p>Archer: Lana, go, AJ is in good hands, I know what I’m doing. I’ve read 10 of The Baby-Sitters Club books.<br>Lana: Really?<br>Archer: Yeah, I’m totally a Kristy with maybe a dash of Claudia.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-505463cf579754159f40830f65cfb241-6-0-0@published data-word-count=44>[<i>+1 point to Archer for identifying the fact that he is an ego-maniacal, bossy tomboy with a penchant for creativity — if they ever made a rated-R version of a </i>Baby-Sitters Club: All Grown Up, <i>H.

She pounds breast milk, while he gets his Claudia on at his in-home bar:</p><p><i>Archer</i>: Tequila and coffee liqueur? All right, so we can make, I guess this will be a black Mexican? What? No, that’s not racist. If you added milk it would be a white Mexican, but all we have is breast milk —&nbsp;<i>ew</i> —&nbsp;which would make it a rusty Krieger.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-505463cf579754159f40830f65cfb241-11-0-0@published data-word-count=35>[+1 to Archer for trying to ensure his daughter is cultured (and for naming a weird, pervy drink after Krieger); +1 to AJ for being a champ and hopefully a well-adjusted child in the future.]</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-505463cf579754159f40830f65cfb241-12-0-0@published data-word-count=45>Before Archer can really enjoy his night, a wounded Slater crashes father-daughter night with a Pakistani spy named Farooq (Kumail Nanjiani) in tow.

It felt like one of those cop-out writing techniques (almost like “Archer wakes up and realizes it was all a dream”). Although Farooq, Cheryl, Pam, and Archer were mostly funny in this episode, “Sitting” served no purpose. It was also a deflating follow-up, compared to last week’s episode, which was nearly flawless. There have been too many stagnant instances in which Lana doesn’t trust Archer’s fatherhood abilities (maybe not outright episodes, but it’s a sentiment we’ve been beaten over the head with). I’m not sure it’s funny anymore; it feels old hat and predictable. Here’s hoping next week’s episode deviates and is either more in line with last week’s, or pushes Lana and Archer’s dynamic to new territory.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-505463cf579754159f40830f65cfb241-45-0-0@published data-word-count=67><b>The MVP</b><br>Farooq. Nanjiani’s voice acting was flawless, Farooq’s facial expressions were hilarious, and his lines were mostly so bad they were good. I kind of want to give Archer some sort of award, but every episode he’s basically just proving that he’s more a dad and less his old self (which is a good or bad thing depending on the type of fan you are, obviously).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-505463cf579754159f40830f65cfb241-46-0-0@published data-word-count=112><b>Extra Splooshes</b></p><ul><li>Archer types on keyboards like a grandparent. He’s not aging well.</li><li>It looks like Archer’s going to <a href=#>drink</a> his gun-shot-wound pain away in the next episode.</li><li>Call off the search party:&nbsp;Woodhouse is either at rehab or having 30 days PTO.</li><li>Although the Farooq reveal was annoying, it <i>does </i>make rewatching the episode about ten-times funnier; it’s kind of like a redemptive two-for-fun episode. (So if you were pissed off, watch again and pay attention to the subtle strokes of ironic genius in the beginning — e.g., Archer calls it from the very beginning. It is not a guaranteed cure for your frustration, but it does help.)</li><li>That was a nice #tbt to Brett and Rodney.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdgZ3yivsKhnKtlopqworyMrJyaq5%2Bjend5xKmgrKeUmnp3edKiq62hnpx7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wwe-breaks-new-record-for-washington-dc-with-smackdown-this-week.html><span>←</span><span>WWE Breaks New Record For Washington, DC With SmackDown This Week</span></a>
