Are they married? What makes them such a solid couple?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>Although their relationship began in 1983, they actually first met in 1966 when both Hawn and Russell had parts in the musical The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band. One reason why sparks didn’t fly right away was because Goldie Hawn was 21 years old, and Kurt Russell was just 16.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>As the years passed, no sparks emerged, since both Hawn and Russell were determined never to date a fellow actor. So, a relationship between the two didn’t start until 17 years after they first met. That’s when both Hawn and Russell auditioned for the movie Swing Shift; a hungover Russell didn’t hold back in complimenting Hawn, which ultimately led to them going on their first date.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>They both won their respective roles for the movie, and began dating while filming together. Goldie Hawn soon took a liking to Kurt’s kindness towards her kids — including then 5-year old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Hudson</a> — when they would visit her on set. Russell also had a young son from a previous marriage.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Their relationship continued to grow, and they welcomed their first child together, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wyatt Russell</a>, in 1986.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Shortly thereafter, the couple starred in Overboard, which has become an often-praised comedy partly because of their on-screen chemistry. Russell plays a man who pretends to be the husband of Hawn’s character, who is suffering from temporary memory loss. Fans of the couple only grew because of the film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>So when did they marry? Well, as many already know, the couple has never actually married. They live life together without the paperwork, and yet have become what many couples aspire to be.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Russell and Hawn told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a> in 2020 that the secret to the success of their union is that they focus on being happy and having a strong family. Hawn also stated, “It’s not about what you do, it’s how you do it.”</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false>The two emphasized that spending time with their family is a key to their overall happiness.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>They’re also still in awe of each other. Hawn told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> in a recent interview, “Kurt is extraordinarily brilliant and creative and collaborative — not in the kitchen! But really he’s just amazing.”</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>Being officially married doesn’t mean they aren’t officially a couple, as Russell told Variety that they “constantly get asked ‘When are you going to get married? Why aren’t you married?’ And we were like, ‘Why does anybody care about that?’”</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Now, they are seven-time grandparents, happily unmarried, and still going strong four decades later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Sus7GMpKyrrF2nwrS%2FxKWjZpmemXqou8udoJ5lmJbEr3nMmqmroZWZerW0xKKpZpyVmK6lsdJmo6iml2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-creatures-great-and-small-recap-season-4-episode-5-html.html><span>←</span><span>All Creatures Great and Small Recap: Driving Lessons</span></a>
