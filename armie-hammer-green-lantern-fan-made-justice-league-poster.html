Recommended Videos That very question has plagued fans for a long, long time now, and though it seems that evidence continues to mount on an almost weekly basis, there’s still been absolutely no concrete proof of the beloved character making an appearance. And unfortunately, that doesn’t look to change. With the film’s November 17th release date quickly approaching and not a single mention of Hal Jordan in any of the marketing material thus far, eager fans will likely have to wait until they head into theatres to find out whether he’ll be included or not."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

As always, it’s an exceptional piece of work from the designer and you can check it out in the gallery down below, along with some of his other recent drawings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DMYUS0kUMAA5zlK.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/150829515920002200_DLinsta.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/150829515150963470_DLinsta.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/150829514439327840_DLinsta.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/150829513815154510_DLinsta.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/150829513164923190_DLinsta.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/150829512493776600_DLinsta.jpg><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Of course, this is hardly a confirmation of any kind that we’ll be seeing the character appear in&nbsp;Justice League, but as we said above, the evidence only continues to mount as we get closer to the film’s release and really, at this point, we’d be shocked if he&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;show up – at least in a quick cameo of some sort.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=774 data-injectable=true>In fact, one popular theory doing the rounds is that Steppenwolf will brainwash Green Lantern to use him against the other heroes, similar to how Loki called upon the Tesseract to seize control of Clint Barton (AKA Hawkeye) in the first&nbsp;Avengers&nbsp;movie. Chalk that up as speculation for now, but there has been some evidence to support it and if true, then&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an evil Superman</a>&nbsp;may be the least of the League’s worries.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Ready to go all in?&nbsp;<strong>Justice League</strong>&nbsp;debuts November 17th, at which point, all will be revealed. Until then, however, feel free to hit the comments section and let us know if you think we’ll be seeing Green Lantern in the film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKulmZp6qa3MppyrZZensqa6jKWYp6yVp7tussCnZKaZlJp6q8HSraCcnV2hsqKz1J5kqaejqbKzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-movie-scenes-scar-you-for-life-torture.html><span>←</span><span>5 Torture Scenes That Will Scar You For Life</span></a>
