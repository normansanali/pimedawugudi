The reputed academy has nurtured the next generation of tennis talent for ages and provided a comprehensive training environment for players of all ages and skill levels.</p><p>Now the academy is all set to return to its former glory under the stewardship of SPORTIME and John McEnroe Tennis Academy (JMTA). In recent news, John McEnroe has taken it upon himself to re-establish the lost aura of the academy and bring back its celebrated status.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>John McEnroe undertakes the restoration of a historic tennis academy</h2><p>One of the largest tennis organizations in the United States, Sportime, partnered with tennis legend John McEnroe to establish the John McEnroe Tennis Academy. They founded the JMTA in 2010 at Sportime’s flagship location on Randall’s Island in New York City. With a focus on excellence in tennis training, the JMTA has quickly become a premier destination for young players seeking the highest level of coaching and development opportunities.</p><p>However, recognizing the importance of yet another academy’s legacy and its potential to continue shaping the future of the sport, JMTA has collaborated with Sportime to rescue it. In a <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>recent interview with Tennis Grand Stand</a>, John McEnroe shared, “The Port Washington Tennis Academy, now SPORTIME Port Washington, is a special New York place that is part of tennis history, and was a big part of my life and my brothers’ lives when we were training as juniors. I am thrilled to be able to expand my Academy to Port Washington, a full circle moment for me. I look forward to supporting and mentoring a new generation of talented and motivated young players there and across the tri-state area.”</p><p>The decision to bring the Historic Port Washington Tennis Academy under the Sportime and JMTA umbrella reflects a commitment to preserving and enhancing the facility’s rich history while providing new opportunities for growth and development. The $7 million renovation and modernization project will include a complete overhaul of the existing infrastructure, with significant upgrades to both indoor and outdoor facilities. Sportime’s enthusiastic CEO is reportedly also in high spirits about the entire endeavor.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Sportime CEO is excited to embark on this new venture</h2><p>The CEO of Sportime, Claude Okin, also shared his feeling about the new venture that his company has undertaken. He recognized that the Port Washington facility is a huge part of American tennis history. Further, he also talked about how it was also a big part of John’s family and history too.</p><p>Thus, Claude plans to restore the facility and his approach towards the entire project is both professionally and personally meaningful. Declaring his pride at being a part of the initiative, he said that he was happy to help bring back the iconic facility to its elite status.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>John McEnroe, Boris Becker, and Others in the Most Shocking Moments of Wimbledon Championships</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Ctp2aslaO7qr%2BMp5ywq12osrexzWakoqScnryvecOoo6WZomK2r8LErKumnZ6perW7jKucZquYlr2medOhnGabn6q%2FtLGMqJ1mrJWju6q%2FjKKlZqaVrHq6u9GkZJqrXZa6pr7InJinZZyatKa6w2ahqKCeYrqksc2rpp5lkZiupbHMsmSpmaKpu6a%2B0madqKpdqbWmedGerZqloGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-david-alpay-all-you-need-to-know-about-him.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is David Alpay?
