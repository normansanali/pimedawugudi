The 13-year-old Aubree trainer, who hails from Azle, went missing on March 22nd, around 7:15 PM.</p><p>The girl who allegedly went missing was last seen in the 1000 block of Boyd Road in Azle. She is physically described as 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighs 103 pounds, and has green eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>At last sight, she was spotted wearing a black T-shirt with a “Tupac” print, tie-dyed pants, white slide shoes, and glasses. Her hair was also tied up in a bun.</p><p>The authorities issued an Amber Alert for the missing 13-year-old trainer. The Amber Alert has the same code as a child abduction emergency alert.&nbsp;</p><p>The alerts distribute a message by a child abduction alert system to ask the public for help in finding abducted children.</p><p>Amber Alerts are specifically issued when a child is suspected to be in life-threatening danger.&nbsp;</p><p>Alerts usually contain a description of the child and the likely abductor. To avoid false alarms and to have alerts ignored as a “wolf cry,” the criteria for issuing an alert are rather strict.</p><p>After the Aubree trainer was declared missing, the police started searching for an unknown white panel van with a Texas license plate.</p><p>The van has two small windows in the back and a medium-sized window on the side.</p><p>The teen trainer was found safe almost 15-16 hours after the authorities issued the Amber Alert.</p><p>The Azle Police Department confirmed that the teen was located on Thursday afternoon safely, and an investigation is underway.&nbsp;</p><p>Azle police confirmed that she was found in the city just northwest of Fort Worth in Parker and Tarrant counties. Police also said she may have left willingly as she probably knew the person she left with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“We do not believe that an ongoing threat to the public exists from this vehicle. If that information changes, we will let you know,”</strong> the Azle Police Department said in a statement on Thursday afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities are investigating the Aubree trainer’s one-day-long disappearance. Cases of missing children are highly sensitive, and making a joke out of them should be an unforgivable crime.&nbsp;</p><p>The issuance of Amber Alerts requires following a strict procedure. In cases like this one, where the missing child is found immediately after the alert is issued, one doubts the alert’s credibility.&nbsp;</p><p>So the missing person’s <a href=#>family</a> should not be discreet when the authorities question them. All the events and details leading upto the disappearance should be mentioned to law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCt1Jupnp1dqb%2Bitc2eqWalmajAqrrGZqarZaOlsq%2BwyKeeZqyZorJuu8WfZK2glWK0s7XDZq6ipJyeu6i42Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-of-miley-cyrus-siblings-in-order-from-noah-to-brandi.html><span>←</span><span>All of Miley Cyrus siblings in order, from Noah to Brandi</span></a>
