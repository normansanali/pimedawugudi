Some called her illiterate, unsanitary, and unscripted. She was called a bad example for other black folks. Critics also noted that the dishes she cooked were loaded with butter, sugar, and grease and would send one to an early grave. However, the criticism didn’t matter, the cause wouldn’t and didn’t change.</p><p>In an interview with a Times article in 2015, she said,</p><p>“I’m gonna keep it 100 and be me. Ain’t nobody gonna tell me I gotta do this, I gotta do that,”</p><p></p><p>The above video is about her and her son debuting in the <a href=#>Steve Harvey</a> show where they had lots of fun.</p><p>She rose to fame for her budget-friendly cooking tips and being real, real comfortable in front of the camera to the point where she had no problem throwing a cuss word or two in whenever it felt good. She said,</p><p>“If you don’t have crescent rolls, you can use any kind of cheap a– donuts or whatever, it doesn’t matter.&nbsp;I don’t know what the f*ck this is, it’s just something sweet for the f*cking kids.”</p><p>One of her most viewed videos, which currently has more than 2 million views, is about feeding a family of seven with just $3.35. Her brother, June O’Dell, told the Times that Fee refused to change her eating habits. She liked to say she took after her father. His father also ate everything he ever wanted and lived to be 99 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/maxresdefault-1.jpg><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">O’Dell said.</a></p><p>“It turns out she took after our mother, who struggled with high blood pressure and diabetes,”</p><p>R.I.P&nbsp;Auntie Fee, You will always be remembered.</p><p>Also read&nbsp;<a class=row-title href=# aria-label="“Catherine Herridge; Donating the liver to save her son; happily married and journalist of Fox news!!!” (Edit)">Catherine Herridge; Donating the liver to save her son; happily married and journalist of Fox news!!!</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_bio_of_Auntie_Fee></span><span>Short bio of Auntie Fee</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Auntie Fee&nbsp;was an American&nbsp;YouTube personality and online cooking show star.
