Eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice the author when she appeared in <a href=#>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before</a>, which premiered via Netflix in August 2018.</p><p>She appeared in a flashback scene where a younger version of <a href=#><strong>Lana Condor</strong></a>’s character, Lara Jean, is attending a homecoming dance with Lucas Krapf, one of her love letter recipients. Han, for her part, played the role of chaperone and watched the two dance.</p><p>While Han admitted that she doesn’t love being filmed, that didn’t stop her from making appearances in the other two To All the Boys franchise films — <a href=#>To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You</a> and <a href=#>To All the Boys: Always and Forever</a>.</p><p>So, when <a href=#>The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> premiered via Prime Video in June 2021, no one was surprised when Han made a brief appearance in one episode.</p><p>“I don’t actually enjoy being on camera at all. I had done it for To All the Boys movies and people kept asking me if I was gonna do it for this one,” she told <a href=#>BuzzFeed</a> in June 2022. “So, then I was like, ‘You know what? Sure.’ I bought [the dress] for that moment. I think it’s a nice scene, very celebratory — and I like champagne.”</p><p>In the show’s first season finale, Han is seen grabbing a glass off a champagne tower while attending Belly’s (<a href=#><strong>Lola Tung</strong></a>) debutante ball.</p><p>“This might have to be my last cameo bc how does one top a champagne tower?” she <a href=#>joked on Instagram</a> at the time, showing off a behind-the-scene photo on set.</p><p>The following year, The Summer I Turned Pretty<a href=#> returned for season 2</a>. While it seemed like Han’s cameo wasn’t going to happen, she surprised fans by walking out of a convenience store as Tung walked in.</p><p>These aren’t the only cameos she’s made thus far!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Netflix’s <a href=#>XO, Kitty</a> isn’t exactly based on one of Han’s books — it’s a To All the Boys spinoff series — she did have a lot of say in the show coming to fruition and acts as an executive producer. Because of this, the writer made another onscreen appearance.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see all of Jenny Han’s iconic cameos so far:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWwrW0zqtko52eo8ZutMCnqmahk6S7qq%2BMpqavoZVirq%2BwjK2tZquYpMRur8CmnKirXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adrian-healey.html><span>←</span><span>Adrian Healey - Bio, Married, Nationality, Height, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
