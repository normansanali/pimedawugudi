He’s also appeared in numerous stage productions, but all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Barrett Foa? As of mid-2017, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $3 million, mostly earned through a successful career in acting, during which he’s appeared in numerous musicals, off-Broadway productions, and Broadway productions. He’s also made guest appearances in popular television shows, and as he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Barrett Foa Net Worth $3 million</h3><p>At a young age, Barrett put together a puzzle in record time which gained him entry to the Dalton School. He would continue his studies there until high school, also spending four summers at the Interlochen Arts Camp to pursue his interest in theatre. After matriculating, he attended the University of Michigan where he studied musical theatre performance. He spent a semester travelling to study Shakespeare, and he acted as part of RADA in London. During the summers, he interned at Johnson-Liff Casting, and also spent time with various stock theater groups including Maine State Music Theater.</p><p>After graduation, Foa found his first major role in the off-Broadway revival of “Godspell”, in which he played Jesus. He then appeared in many other productions, and made his Broadway debut in 2001 as part of the original cast of “Mamma Mia!” He spent six months with the show and then left to take a 3-month job at Theatre Works in which he got the lead role in a musical entitled “Kept”. He then starred in “The Fantasticks” as Matt, before being picked to become a part of “Much Ado About Nothing” which was a dual production. Afterwards, he played Mordred in “Camelot” before being cast in the play “Cupid and Psyche” as Cupid. All of these opportunities helped in building his net worth.</p><p>During his time in New York, he auditioned for the Broadway production “Avenue Q”, which led him to become an understudy. After a year, he was given the lead role and played that for about a year and a half. He was then cast to be part of the Broadway musical “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee”, and in 2007 he appeared in both “The Pirates of Penzance” and “The Lady In Question”. The following year, he was cast as Eddie in “The Drunken City” before becoming a part of “The Nightingale” in a workshop presentation. In the same year, he was cast in the musical “Giant”, all contributing steadily to his net worth.</p><p>In 2009, Barrett became a part of the series “NCIS: Los Angeles” as Eric Beale, a technical operator in the Office of Special Projects. His was initially just a recurring role, but was promoted to a series regular the following year. A few of his latest projects include the musical “For the Record: John Hughes” and the web series “My Synthesized Life”, so his net worth continues to grow.</p><p>Not much is known about Barrett’s personal life; some websites list him as gay.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Graduated from The Dalton School.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Attended Interlochen Arts Camp for four summers.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>Studied at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>Graduate of The University of Michigan.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>Born and raised in Manhattan.</td></tr></table><p><a href=# class="shortc-button medium green"><span class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden=true></span> All pictures</a></p><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>NCIS: Los Angeles</td><td>2009-2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Eric Beale</td></tr><tr><td>My Synthesized Life</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Craig Carter</td></tr><tr><td>Submissions Only</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Gil Bure</td></tr><tr><td>Entourage</td><td>2009-2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Matt Wolpert</td></tr><tr><td>The Closer</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Travis Myers</td></tr><tr><td>NCIS</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Eric Beale</td></tr><tr><td>Numb3rs</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Andrew Gibbons</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Prop 8: The Musical</td><td>2008</td><td>Short</td><td>California Gays and The People That Love Them</td></tr><tr><td>Six Degrees</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Dylan</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Schoolhouse Rock!</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series performer -
