For May 2012 she released her promotional single “Play It Again” and, in July of the following year, she released an EP with the same name, made up of four unreleased songs; one of them with the outstanding&nbsp;Pitbull.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Around that same time, she advanced something from her debut album during the Access Hollywood program, where she mentioned that it would be about the pop genre and Latin sounds. She also said that it would have producers such as Benny Blanco, The Jam, Ammo, and Will.i.am, and the participation of Jennifer López, Pitbull, and Will.i.am.</p><p>Soon after she participated in the song “Quiero Bailar (All Through The Night)”, which was included in the album&nbsp;“Globall”&nbsp;by&nbsp;3BallMTY.

I was her fan, I love his style” In addition to this, she said that it was of great importance in her career, as it was the first song that Bad Bunny made in a musical genre other than the trap.</p><p>Around this time, Becky G had a very unpleasant time on the&nbsp;Fifth Harmony&nbsp;tour.at Luna Park in Buenos Aires, Argentina, because when she had to enter the stage to pass one of the flags to a member of said group, one of the security officials mistook her for a spectator and withdrew her backstage. Singer Ally Brooke then came over to clear up the misunderstanding, whereupon the show continued as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Although she took her first steps making music in English, Becky G has developed her skills as a singer and songwriter to also express herself on songs in Spanish;&nbsp;something you always wanted to do.&nbsp;In mid-2017 she was a co-star in the movie&nbsp;“Power Rangers”, playing Trini, the yellow ranger.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Becky G premiered her single in Spanish</h3><p>In that same season, Becky G premiered her single in Spanish.“Everything changed”, with two remixes, one with CNCO and the other with J Quiles.
