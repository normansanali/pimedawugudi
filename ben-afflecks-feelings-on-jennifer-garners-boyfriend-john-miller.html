The first insider said the stars are making “their children the focus of those relationships.” Ben and Jennifer share three kids:&nbsp;<strong>Violet Anne,&nbsp;</strong>17,&nbsp;<strong>Seraphina Rose,&nbsp;</strong>14, and&nbsp;<strong>Samuel,&nbsp;</strong>11. John shares two kids with his ex-wife.

Back when the&nbsp;Good Will Hunting&nbsp;star was engaged to J.Lo in May 2022, an insider told <strong>Hollywood Life&nbsp;</strong>exclusively that Jennifer and John were working on making <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a “blended family”</a> with their kids. “Like J.Lo and Ben, their kids have&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>met each other</a> and they are becoming a blended family of their own,” the source said. “Ben has known John for some time and he knows what a good father he is, so he respects John. Don’t expect a double date between the four of them, but everything is good and there is no bad blood.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ben and Jennifer split up in 2015, and she started dating John in 2018. It’s also been reported that the&nbsp;13 Going on 30&nbsp;star and her beau are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“in a great place”</a> as they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebrate five years together.</a> “They used to go out of their way to keep a low profile, but they’ve both become very secure with their relationship and how it’s all worked out,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5JpZpudnmKup7LLnpqkq12bsqa4yKeerGWfo3qrsc2noJ%2BdomK0or7NnqmsZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWWapLWvecyio6WdomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./an-inside-look-at-what-its-like-working-with-jj-abrams.html><span>←</span><span>An Inside Look At What It's Like To Work With JJ Abrams</span></a>
