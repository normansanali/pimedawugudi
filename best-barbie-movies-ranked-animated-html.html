If the marketing for a <a href=#>certain summer blockbuster</a> hasn’t made that clear enough, the bright-blonde, slender-framed, blue-eyed doll is, and she has been able to do anything she (well, Mattel execs) puts her plastic mind to. The upcoming Greta Gerwig–directed film isn’t Barbie’s first foray into cinema, of course: Since the turn of the millennium, Barbie has crossed over from kids’ dreamhouses into the televisions of young kids (and nostalgic zillennials), first through straight-to-video movies.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk8kbwrf000d3b7238q11mby@published data-word-count=98>For almost 20 years, Barbie has been a countless number of princesses, ballet dancers, and types of fairies, but she has also been a musketeer, an indentured servant (once), and kind of a bitch (see No. 19 on this list). These movies have never reached the animated innovation of Studio Ghibli’s stunners or even the least-beloved Disney titles, but that has always been okay because Barbie movies are just meant to make your mind play. The tactile CGI animation always made it feel as if you could physically pull Barbie out of the screen and into your dreamhouse.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk8kbwyr000e3b72aksmdxjo@published data-word-count=148>The foray into films was, of course, a Mattel marketing tactic: The company started producing its own Barbie movies to have the doll join the <a href=#>new digital frontier</a>. At the same time, television channels like Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel were on the rise as they started to focus on original children’s entertainment. Thus came 2001’s Barbie in the Nutcracker, Mattel Entertainment’s first full-length Barbie feature. After Nutcracker’s success, Nickelodeon formed a broadcasting partnership with Mattel to air its animated films, starting with Barbie As Rapunzel, after physical-media releases. The deal ran for 17 years until Mattel moved into the streaming world, culminating in 41 non–<a href=#>Greta Gerwig</a> Barbie movies in total — some of which are not that bad, actually. So to whet your appetite for what’s sure to be the splashiest Barbie movie yet, we’ve rewatched and meticulously ranked all the old ones from worst to best.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk6bxfhj00c93b71vt5gw5ge@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>41.</p></span>The Barbie Diaries (2006)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk6bxobg00cm3b71vaucorji@published data-word-count=48>A wild change of pace for Barbie at the time, The Barbie Diaries takes our heroine out of the storybooks and into high school to cosplay as a sandal-bootcut-jeans-wearing Y2K teenager.

As someone who spent hours of their childhood playing Barbie CD-ROM games, the idea of this movie was validating, but its execution as a movie is disturbing to look at. It’s uncanny valley to the max as Barbie is sucked into a dizzying video game. I accept that this is not for me, but absolutely for the iPad kids of today.

As a Pixie Hollow scholar though, Fairytopia has a hard time competing since its lore is not as strong (why are the fairies the same size as the mermaids???) and Elina’s outfit and boring bun are not cute.

They both loosely adapt the same fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen. Who says Barbie isn’t cinema? As the last adapted work in the Barbie animated oeuvre, The Pink Shoes tries to weave together an amalgam of fairy tales, including The Snow Queen as ballet dancer Kristin moves through a magical world. It’s a nostalgic end to what launched the original animated movies, except when they trade off the Tchaikovsky and Beethoven for generic Y2K pop.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk2w3hxl00cy3b6x3rmw7c7p@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>15.</p></span>Barbie in a Mermaid Tale (2010)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk2w3f1u00cr3b6x9clcivc2@published data-word-count=31>A Blue Crush surfer named Merliah figures out she’s actually half-mermaid after a pink dolphin explains why she suddenly got chunky pink highlights in her hair out of nowhere.

Dolphin Magic doesn’t even feature the dreamhouse, but I forgive them because this is Mattel’s Avatar: The Way of Water.

Along with Fairytopia, it was one of the first original-story Barbie movies Mattel Entertainment released. It didn’t spawn sequels like its counterpart, but this fairy tale exudes all the drama and couture of its predecessors. There were big stakes (a kingdom cursed to stone and a sister doomed to stay a pegasus forever), romance (Ken power-walked here so Tangled’s Flynn Ryder could run), and great fantastical elements (a Cloud Kingdom where cute cherubs cast spells to create rainbows, sunsets, and sunrises) as the determined Princess Annika, her sister Brietta, and their adorable little polar-bear friend Shiver adventured to find the mythical Wand of Light.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk2v40h7003n3b6xmm1pnp33@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>2.</p></span>Barbie As the Princess and the Pauper (2004)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk2v45nt00443b6xeohq79yj@published data-word-count=127>This movie is itching for a Margot Robbie and Emma Mackey live-action treatment — though apparently neither looks like the other <a href=#>when they’re all dolled up</a>. Either way, Barbie As the Princess and the Pauper easily stands on its own because no other Barbie movie has an original soundtrack as remembered and coveted as Princess and the Pauper. (Sorry, <a href=#>Barbie the Album</a>.) Sing out “I’m just like you” in the theater before Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, and I guarantee you a wave of “you’re just like me”’s will hit you right back. But beyond the music itself, Princess Anneliese and Erika’s twin swap — Erika takes Anneliese’s place after she’s kidnapped by Martin Short’s Preminger to save the kingdom from bankruptcy — is plenty entertaining on its own</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk2v1r4b003e3b6x9v6aw3bf@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>1.</p></span>Barbie in the Nutcracker (2001)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk2v1is6002z3b6xtnobxgzh@published data-word-count=139>Nutcracker is really the “<a href=#>Alien Superstar</a>” of the Barbie Animated Cinematic Universe because you really don’t even want to waste time trying to compete with her. The glamor and nostalgia of Christmas really help as this Barbie movie recounts the story of Clara and her Nutcracker as they try to defend Parthenia from the Mouse King (voiced by Tim Curry — the words Sugarplum Princess have never been more enunciated) by going on a search for the lost princess. Barbie in the Nutcracker simply is the hallmark of what a Barbie movie would be for the next few years: memorable music (in this case, music from Tchaikovsky’s ballet), gorgeous choreography and action, spectacular gowns, adorable romance, a high-profile villain voice actor, and a high rewatchability factor. It’s just physically and emotionally impossible to not rank this at number one.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cljydj13l00000pcqh7u5pek9@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Is This What the Barbie Movie Is About Or Am I Crazy?</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clbr0bqih000p0idzph8xgj0p@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Which Barbies Are Gonna Be in Barbie?</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Let’s Revisit the 41 Other Barbie Movies</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyjsdKtZJuZope2pnnMqK2inaNiv6K6yp6bZpmenrqiwMSdZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guido-messina-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-530429-html.html><span>←</span><span>Guido Messina Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
