I hope your day is filled with love. ♥️&nbsp;#FathersDay#HappyFathersDay”</p><h2>Gwyneth Paltrow</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Happy Father’s Day to our Brad Falchuk,” Gwyneth, 50, captioned her Instagram Story pics of the <i>Glee</i>&nbsp;producer, 52, with his&nbsp;daughter <strong>Izzy</strong>, 18, and son <strong>Brody</strong>, 16, whom he shares with his ex <strong>Suzanne Bukinik.</strong>&nbsp;“He is the greatest, [a] great dog dad [and a] great stepdad.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The Oscar winner also shared a sweet snap of her kids,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> daughter <strong>Apple</strong> and son <strong>Moses</strong></a>, with their father, <strong>Cold Play</strong> singer Chris. “And Happy Father’s Day to this guy,” she captioned the IG Story pic.</p><h2>Demi Moore</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Demi Moore</strong>, who has an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazing relationship</a> with her ex <strong>Bruce Willis</strong>, took to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share a sweet throwback snap of Bruce with their three daughters <strong>Rumer</strong>, <strong>Scout</strong> and <strong>Tallulah Willis</strong>. “Forever grateful to you BW for giving me these three beautiful girls. We love our #girldad. Happy Father’s Day!” the actress wrote. The tribute had special meaning, as Bruce has been struggling with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>frontotemporal dementia</a>.</p><h2>Emma Heming Willis</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Bruce’s current wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emma Heming Willis</strong></a>, with whom he shares two daughters <strong>Mabel</strong>, 11, and <strong>Evelyn</strong>, 9, made sure to celebrate her husband as well. “Father’s Day&nbsp;is a time I get to reflect on my deep appreciation and respect I have for Bruce as I watch him father our little ones. Where it might not be ‘conventional,’ what he’s teaching them will span generations. Unconditional love, kindness, strength, compassion, patience, generosity, resilience. Happy Father’s Day to the greatest dad I know, who will forever be the gift that keeps giving within our family,” Emma wrote alongside her post.</p><h2>Kate Hudson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a> honored<strong> Kurt Russell</strong> with a photo of him surrounded by his grandchildren. “Oh how we love you Pa!

On one Father’s Day, Oliver said “Happy Abandonment Day” on social media, while Kate simply posted a photo of herself and Kurt. However, Kate has made peace with the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;“I did understand that it didn’t have to do with me and Oliver,” Kate said about Bill being absent during their childhood in an interview&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Howard Stern</a>&nbsp;</strong>in 2016. “I do really recognize that whatever those issues are, are just something that he has to live with, and that must be painful for him. And so I forgive him.”</p><h2>Mindy Kaling</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>Mindy has yet to reveal the paternity of her two gorgeous children, so fans were curious about her shout-out on Father’s Day. The Never Have I Ever show creator took to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to celebrate her own father <strong>Avu Chokalingam</strong>, who plays a special role in her kids’ lives. “My dad shows up. He was the one who drove me from the hospital after both my kids were born,” the star wrote alongside a snap of her dad playing with her kids. “Whoever it is for your family – husband, partner, grandparent, mom, wife, step-parent, nanny, sibling, old friend – I hope you have someone out there who shows up for you and your family!
