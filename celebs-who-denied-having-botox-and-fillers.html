Since then, Winslet has found herself under the microscope, with strangers regularly critiquing her appearance. However, the Oscar-winner&nbsp;refuses to be influenced by external pressures when it comes to how she looks, with Winslet remaining resolute that she will never undergo plastic surgery or receive aesthetic adjustments like Botox and fillers. In 2011, she told <a href=#>The Telegraph</a>, "It goes against my morals, the way that my parents brought me up and what I consider to be natural beauty ... I will never give in."</p><p>In 2015, <a href=#>Harper's Bazaar</a>&nbsp;asked Winslet if she'd ever had Botox or fillers in her face, and her response was simply brilliant, telling the publication, "Oh, f*** no!" During the same interview, the "Mare of Easttown" star revealed that she relishes getting older and the confidence it brings her. "What is so gorgeous, so really, truly, bloody gorgeous about being the age I am is that all the ridiculous angst that I might once have felt about having a bit of cellulite, or being a bit puffy in the face, or whatever, has just evaporated," she explained. "I simply can't believe I ever spent any time wasting my life on that nonsense."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtjaH55g46cnKWdkqh6uLTOZpueppmasW60wK%2Bgp59dl7y1u9dmmKecXZu2rbjEq6po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-attend-church-service-amid-his-rehab.html><span>←</span><span>Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner Attend Church Service Amid His Rehab</span></a>
