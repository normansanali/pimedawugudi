He began his karting career in 2005, and in that year, as well as in 2006 and 2008, he won the French PACA Championship.</p><p>He debuted in Formula One with Sauber in 2018. Leclerc raced for Ferrari in the #16 car in 2019. He finished in 13th place in 2018 and won the Belgian and Italian Grand Prix races in 2019. In 2017, Charles Leclerc debuted in the FIA Formula 2 Championship.</p><p>In 2016 and 2017, he served as a test driver for Formula One. In 2016 for ART Grand Prix, Leclerc won the GP3 Series, and in 2017 for Prema Racing, he won the FIA Formula 2 Championship. He was close friends with the late Jules Bianchi, who served as Leclerc’s godfather, and the two were like family.</p><p>Since Olivier Beretta in 1994, he was the first Monegasque driver in the Formula One.</p><p>Ferrari bought Leclerc in 2019 to take Kimi Raikkonen’s seat.</p><p>Leclerc received a brand-new contract at the conclusion of his rookie campaign, and he is now committed to Ferrari through the end of the 2024 season.</p><p>His estimated annual wage is £9.8 million ($12 million), which is comparable to that of his colleague Carlos Sainz but significantly less than the around £40 million that Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen take home each year.</p><p>Who are the parents of Charles Leclerc?
