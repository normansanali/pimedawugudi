Nothing makes me happier than seeing your photos of Modern Honey recipes made in your home. It is the best part of my job! &nbsp;One of the highlights of my job is finding those recipes that are knockouts…..the ones that I CAN’T wait to get out to you. These are the recipes that become staples in my own kitchen and hopefully yours for years to come. I have already tested, shot, and edited 27 recipes but am constantly adding to the list and this <strong>Cheesy Baked Rigatoni</strong> just shot up to the numero uno spot. I made it a few nights ago and just couldn’t wait weeks to get it out to you!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DSC_1142-copy.jpg alt="Cheesy Baked Rigatoni.

I have made baked ziti before and even though it has been good, I wanted to take it up a notch. When I traveled to Chicago for the first time last Fall to be a part of <span><a href=#><strong>Nestle’s BAKE SOME GOOD</strong></a></span> event, it was in the middle of the World Series. The Cubs were playing away but the spirit and excitement in the city was palpable. &nbsp;I walked around the city by myself exploring and soaking up the city. Of course I ate deep dish pizza and Italian food and walked around one of my favorite places, Eataly by Mario Batali. If you haven’t been, make it happen! It is a foodie’s dream. I love a good deal and found that every single cookbook was 50% off! I was in heaven!</p><p>Now, even though I traveled with a tiny carry-on suitcase, I was going to bring home some cookbooks! I sat in the cafe, eating some out-of-this-world dessert and perused cookbooks for 2 hours. People must have thought I was absolutely nuts with a stack of 25 cookbooks on my little table. I never buy a cookbook without fully immersing myself in the content.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DSC_1187-copy-1.jpg alt="Cheesy Baked Rigatoni.

This Mario Batali cookbook talked about the art of baked pasta. This<strong> Cheesy Baked Rigatoni&nbsp;</strong>uses a bechamel sauce made with butter, milk, flour, and a touch of nutmeg. When the pasta is covered in bechamel suace, it stays moist and rich when baked. No dried out pasta here! Bechamel sauce keeps it creamy while baking. Adding a touch of nutmeg adds to warmth to the sauce. I have changed up the recipe to add more sauce and parmesan cheese since those are extremely important in Italian food, right?</p><p>The homemade marinara sauce is crazy simple using only quality canned tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, crushed red pepper, and salt. So easy! The cooked <span><strong>rigatoni or ziti pasta is covered with the handcrafted marinara sauce, creamy bechamel sauce, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese and olive oil garlic bread crumbs</strong></span>. The bread crumbs is what makes this unbelievably good. The pasta melts in your mouth surrounded by the creamy sauce and cheeses but the crumb topping adds a crunch to balance it all out. This is the most surprising part of the dish — everyone goes crazy for the crunchy topping! The <span><strong>key is that the panko bread crumbs are tossed with olive oil and a touch of garlic salt for extra flavor.</strong></span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DSC_1158-copy.jpg alt="Cheesy Baked Rigatoni.
