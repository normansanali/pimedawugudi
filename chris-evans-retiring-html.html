In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ Magazine</a>, Evans said he’s become more selective about the projects he works on as he prefers to spend time enjoying life with his family.</p><p>“Now it’s really about, well… What time of year are we filming? Am I gonna miss autumn? You know, I don’t want to miss autumn. I only have so many of them,” Chris Evans said. “I could just make furniture for nobody and be happy. I don’t want to – I’ve got to frame this the right way. I was going to say I don’t want to waste too much time in this industry, but that doesn’t really feel… That doesn’t sound correct. I don’t want to occupy too much space in an industry that I’ve already poured 20 years into.”</p><p>However, Chris Evans admits that semi-retirement often makes him doubt his drive to succeed. “Sometimes I wonder if I’m lacking some sort of – like, I think I’m a very driven person. I have a lot of energy. I wake up early, I get a lot done in a day, but it’s not always focused on acting. Sometimes, reading a script is the last thing I want to do. I haven’t worked all year, and I don’t plan to, which has been lovely,” he said.</p><p><strong>“I could just make furniture for nobody and be happy.

He recognizes the fortunate position he’s achieved, which not only brings him peace of mind about the future but also aids in managing severe anxiety.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/push-chris-evans-900x506.jpg><p>“If I wanted to stop everything now, I could, which is incredible. And that’s a blessing beyond words. Specifically, because life is unpredictable and anything can happen,” Chris Evans explained. “I’m a bit of an over-planner. I try to set things up so that any sort of future curveball that happens, I’ve planned for it. And that’s ostensibly exactly what Marvel’s provided.”</p><p>“And part of that relaxing is just putting my brain down, putting my anxiety down. And the analysis, the kind of planning for tomorrow. I don’t have to do that as much anymore, and I can just be present,” Chris Evans continued. “I like autonomous things. I’d like to just smoke a joint, put on some music, and, like, get into pottery. You know what I mean?”</p><p><strong>“I wake up early, I get a lot done in a day, but it’s not always focused on acting. Sometimes, reading a script is the last thing I want to do. I haven’t worked all year, and I don’t plan to, which has been lovely.”</strong></p>Chris Evans<p>Chris Evans’ wanting to spend less time working is probably related to his recent marriage to Portuguese actress Alba Baptista. The couple wed in a private ceremony on September 9 in Evans’ home state of Massachusetts. According to several reports, the ceremony was attended by close family and friends, including his fellow <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Avengers data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Avengers</a>, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, and Jeremy Renner.</p><p>News of Chris Evans and Alba Baptista’s relationship first surfaced in November 2022, with reports stating that they had been dating for over a year and were deeply committed to each other. A source close to the couple shared, “They are in love, and Chris has never been happier. His family and friends all adore her.”</p><p><strong>I don’t have to do that as much anymore, and I can just be present. I like autonomous things. I’d like to just smoke a joint, put on some music, and, like, get into pottery. You know what I mean?”</strong></p>Chris Evans<p>Baptista, who speaks five languages and hails from a family of an engineer and a translator, has made her mark in the entertainment industry with roles in projects like&nbsp;Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris&nbsp;and Netflix’s&nbsp;Warrior Nun. She also received the Shooting Star award at the Berlin Film Festival in 2021, further establishing her as a rising star in the industry, independent of her new husband.</p><p>Chris Evans shared glimpses of his relationship with Baptista on Valentine’s Day with photos and videos of their adventures together. These moments included hiking trips and quality time with his rescue dog, Dodger. Despite their high-profile status, the couple managed to keep their relationship private for nearly two years.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chris-evans-discusses-a-marvel-comeback><strong>Chris Evans Discusses A Marvel Comeback</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/chris-evans-captain-america-900x506.jpg><p>While Chris Evans is enjoying life after <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Marvel data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Marvel</a>, he isn’t entirely ruling out the prospect of making a comeback in the Cinematic Universe, but it won’t be any time soon. “I’ll never say never, just because it was such a wonderful experience,” he told GQ. “But I’m also very precious with it. It’s something that I am very proud of. And like I said, sometimes I can’t believe it even happened.”</p><p>“And I wouldn’t want the black eye if it felt like a cash grab or if it didn’t live up to expectations or if it just felt like it wasn’t connected to that original thing. So, no time soon,” he added. Chris Evans’ tenure in the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=MCU data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>MCU</a> began in 2011 with&nbsp;Captain America: The First Avenger, where the character transformed from a frail young man into a super-soldier and symbol of hope during World War II.</p><p><strong>“I’ll never say never, just because it was such a wonderful experience.”</strong></p>Chris Evans on a potential Marvel return<p>Chris Evans reprised the role in several MCU films, including&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;in 2012,&nbsp;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&nbsp;in 2014, Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;in 2015,&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;in 2016,&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;in 2018, and&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame&nbsp;in 2019.
