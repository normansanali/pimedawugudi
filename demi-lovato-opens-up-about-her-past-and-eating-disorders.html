I like Demi Lovato. Unlike most other female celebrities who slipped up and could not manage to find their footing again, Lovato has done the opposite. She overcame her set backs and rose back up to fame by being strong, driven, and not letting her past hold her down. Be ready to like her even more, as the young singer comes clean about her troubled past and even some issues she had with eating disorders. We know people twice her age who would not be brave enough to address these things, so the young diva has impressed us yet again.</p><p><a href=#>The Examiner</a> talks more about it, but the young singer had an eye-opening interview with Fox news recently, and nothing was taboo or off the record for Demi Lovato. She talked about how she struggled with her weight and self image. She talks about how she got derailed and distracted by some of the substances that are common in that world. But what she really talks about is how she overcame those things, and did not let them hinder her or hold her back. She even wrote a book of affirmations she is releasing to help other young people get through the struggle of their own.</p><p>Come on, who doesn’t love a success story with a happy ending?
