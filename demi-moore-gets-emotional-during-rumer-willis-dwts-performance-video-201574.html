Dancing With the Stars contestant <strong><a href=#>Rumer Willis</a></strong> received some star-studded support on Monday, April 6, from her mom <strong><a href=#>Demi Moore</a></strong>, sister <strong>Tallulah Willis</strong>, and family friend <strong>Glenn Close</strong>.</p><p>On the show, Willis shared painful memories of being bullied during her formative years in Hollywood. “When I was a teenager I was super awkward,” she reflected. “I don’t think I really felt comfortable in my body or with how I looked and people were nasty.”</p><p>Willis, now 26, explained how she grappled with her looks for years. “For years I thought ‘Maybe I can get plastic surgery… If I change my face or get really skinny, that will be it, that will be the answer,'” she said, wiping away tears. “And it’s not.”</p><p>In fact, she found the answer with the help of her famous family. “My sister Tallulah was in rehab and I was inspired,” Rumer shared, “because she didn’t try to hide from it. She really owned it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>During her heartfelt confessional, Moore, 52, held up her hands in a “namaste” position as she whispered in Tallulah’s ear. Moore’s former mother-in-law<strong> Marlene Willis</strong> was seated to her left and proudly beamed at her granddaughter from the audience. Meanwhile, Close appeared to be emotional and appreciative of Rumer’s honesty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Those same emotions were echoed after Rumer’s beautiful performance of <strong><a href=#>Adele</a></strong>‘s “Turning Tables” with <strong>Val Chmerkovskiy</strong>. Moore was seen getting teary-eyed in the audience after her daughter’s powerful waltz to the hit.</p><p>Following the show, Rumer told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> and other reporters about her relationship with her sisters.</p><p>“We kind of have this infectious laughter where one of us starts laughing and the other one will go and it just kind of continues,” she said of how she bonds with<strong> Tallulah</strong>, 21, and <strong>Scout</strong>, 23. “I’m honestly probably the most grateful that I have such an incredibly strong bond with my two sisters that are older and I hope that one day you know all five of us can really have that.” (Rumer also has two half-sisters, <strong>Evelyn</strong> and <strong>Mabel</strong>, her father <strong><a href=#>Bruce Willis</a></strong>‘ young kids with second wife<strong> Emma Heming</strong>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for Rumer’s <a href=#>dynamic with her divorced parents</a>? “I wish I could see them more,” she said of Bruce, 60, and Moore. “As I’ve gotten older and living in separate places, I don’t get to see them as much. Just you know, we’re a really goofy, awkward group of people. We love to have game nights and be silly. One of the best things you can have in your family is the ability to just laugh with each other and spend time and I think that we are able to do that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Watch part of Rumer’s performance above, including her mom’s reaction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuepZliurC70Z5koJ2kqHqmuc6toKimkaF6pcHRoqWgZaKquqa%2BjLCgpaSZqHqlw9OsZKmdopu8s7nAp5qeZaaesaa7jGtnam1naXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrea-ama-aboagye-biography-wikipedia-age-nationality-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>Andrea Ama Aboagye Biography: Wikipedia, Age, Nationality, Pictures</span></a>
