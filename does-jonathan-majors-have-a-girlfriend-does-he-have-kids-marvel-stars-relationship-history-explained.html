While the Lovecraft Country actor has kept his private life to himself for the most part, this newfound scrutiny stemming from his criminal behavior has prompted public interest in his dating history. Many are wondering who Majors is seeing and who he has dated in the past.</p><h2 id=h-does-jonathan-majors-have-a-girlfriend data-injectable=false>Does Jonathan Majors have a girlfriend?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jonathan-majors-meagan-good-court.jpg><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Yes. Jonathan Majors is currently dating 42-year-old actress Meagan Good. They struck up a romance in May 2023, just two months after ex-girlfriend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jabbari accused Majors of domestic abuse</a>. The actress has played a role in Marvel’s biggest competitor, the DC Universe, as the older version of Darla in the two Sahazam! movies.</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good first rose to prominence in the late 1990s</a> and early aughts with a slew of popular performances in the likes of Eve’s Bayou, Nickelodeon’s Cousin Skeeter, Roll Bounce, and Stomp the Yard. Currently, most people will know her from the Prime Video television series Harlem. The two have been close, attending every court session together, as well as events like the Congressional Black Caucus’ annual Black and White Gala in September where Majors referred to his girlfriend as his “missus.”</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>Although Majors was also linked to Lori Harvey in the media for a short while, before Good, Majors’ only public relationship was with Jabbari. It lasted for two years and ended on that fateful March evening in New York. They met on the set of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania</a> in 2021, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a>, where Jabbari was working as a movement coach. Evidence revealed in court painted the relationship as toxic, exposing some of Majors’ manipulative behavior.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Jabbari reportedly shared that, in the early months of the relationship, the Emmy nominee would write her poetry and that he told her he loved her. “[It] was overwhelming, but I loved it as well.” The dancer said the first signs of hostility came in December, when he first yelled at her, and built up from there.</p><h2 id=h-does-jonathan-majors-have-a-child data-injectable=false>Does Jonathan Majors have a child?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Loki-season-2-finale-he-who-remains-4-1.png><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Jonathan Majors has a 9-year-old daughter, Ella Majors, who lives in Atlanta, Texas, with her mother. The nature of his relationship with the mother of his daughter remains unknown, and it is also uncertain whether she ever was his wife or girlfriend at any point. Talking about his daughter, the Creed III star told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> that he became a father while attending college at Yale School of Drama.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=800 data-injectable=true>Even though information about his daughter and her mother remains scarce, Majors has claimed to be a doting father who loves and adores his only child. In the 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ebony</a>, Majors shared information about his daughter, who he mentioned is biracial, as he criticized the American educational system for not doing a good enough job of teaching Black history in school to youngsters like Ella.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=false>He also opened up about how his daughter has always been supportive of his career, and was awestruck with his performance in Ant-Man alongside Paul Rudd. He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TODAY</a>, “All she understands is that I’m in a movie with Paul Rudd, with Ant-Man. I’ve never seen my daughter starstruck. She’s like, ‘Nice to see you, too’ to Paul Rudd, and I lost my mind. I was like ‘What did you say?’ Oh my god.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxsLHSZqGoppGptaK6jKaYo6eiqHqprdWeZJpll56%2FrbLRopynnF2ZvKa%2FjKGcZqCRq7Jut8idqmalkafDpriMrKuaqqNiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxeceiqq2noq56psTPpZiippWZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-hollins.html><span>←</span><span>Brian Hollins- Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Career</span></a>
