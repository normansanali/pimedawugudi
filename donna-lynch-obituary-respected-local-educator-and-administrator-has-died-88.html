Born on June 8, 1935, in Highland Park, Michigan, she dedicated over three decades to the field of education. Donna graduated from Elyria Catholic High School in 1953 and earned her BA degree in Education from Kent State University in 1971, followed by an MA from LaVerne College in 1980.</p><p>Her career began at Belden Elementary, where she served as a teacher for 13 years. Donna then transitioned to become the Principal of Grafton Elementary for eight years. Notably, she participated in a groundbreaking NASA pilot project, transforming old school buses into space ships. Students played astronauts, traveling between the schools as if they were planets. This unique initiative gained national attention, earning coverage in newspapers and magazines.</p><p>Donna Lynch retired from Midview in 1995, leaving an indelible mark on the education community. A devoted member of St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Medina for over 50 years, she cherished her family and enjoyed activities such as camping, traveling, and attending her grandchildren’s athletic events. Donna is survived by her five children: Cathleen Lynch of Seville, Ohio; Patricia Van Leeuwen (Mark) of Fowlerville, Michigan; Charles Lynch (Sharon) of Sheffield Lake, Ohio; Christopher Lynch of Ft. Myers Beach, Florida; and Michael Lynch of Kentucky. She leaves behind a legacy as a grandmother of 15 and great-grandmother of 17.</p><p>Preceded in death by her husband of 60 years, Charles R. Lynch, Donna also joins her parents, Thomas and Dorothy (Reardon) Glunt, and siblings, Thomas Glunt II and Kathy Parks. A memorial visitation is scheduled for Tuesday, January 9, 2024, from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Duke Funeral Home, 1021 Main St., Grafton, OH. The community gathers to celebrate the life of a woman who touched the lives of many through her dedication to education and her warm, familial spirit.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsM6npZplnK67pLSMqJmirKWWv7p50Z6qqZ2TqbKlecuompqkXZqxtq%2FAraarZZGjsW6tw6agp6Gjqb%2BiwM6rZKGZo2KxqrHDZm9xZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chicago-blackhawks-beloved-announcer-pat-foley-calls-last-hockey-game.html><span>←</span><span>Chicago Blackhawks beloved announcer Pat Foley calls last hockey game</span></a>
