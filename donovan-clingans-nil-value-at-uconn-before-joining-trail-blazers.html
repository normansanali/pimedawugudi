One of the top big men coming out of the 2024 NBA Draft is Donovan Clingan. The star center out of the UConn basketball program has popped off and surpassed Dan Hurley’s expectations despite being a freshman back in 2022-23. He then proceeded to retain his high level of intensity on the court in his second year which led to an even higher NIL valuation. All of this prompted the Portland Trail Blazers to acquire him as a key part of their rebuild post-Damian Lillard."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The <a href=#>star center out of the UConn basketball program </a>has popped off and surpassed Dan Hurley’s expectations despite being a freshman back in 2022-23. He then proceeded to retain his high level of intensity on the court in his second year which led to an even higher NIL valuation. All of this prompted the Portland Trail Blazers to acquire him as a key part of their rebuild post-Damian Lillard.</span></p><p data-mce-fragment=1><span data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Trail Blazers selected Donovan Clingan with the seventh overall pick of the 2024 NBA Draft. This two-time national champion out of Dan Hurley’s UConn basketball program knows exactly how to play a role while also still having a championship mentality. While the Trail Blazers are from postseason contention, he can surely give them a boost in their frontcourt. Moreover, he can surely notch the benefits of having big endorsements just like his run with the Huskies.</span></p><p data-mce-fragment=1><span data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Donovan Clingan had an estimated NIL value of $800,000 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">after his last year</a> with the UConn basketball program, per On 3 Sports. A lot of it comes from his senior season and these deals are likely going to carry over to when he finally notches a rotation spot in the Trail Blazers roster.</span></p><p data-mce-fragment=1><span data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The first deal that the 7-footer managed to secure at Storrs dates back to January 30 of 2023. Clingan inked a contract with F45 South Training and a lot of companies followed suit after. Throughout his whole freshman campaign, he managed to sign three deals after F45. Those brands were namely Incrediwear, Dunkin’, and Panini America. With the popular donut brand, he even got to work with the likes of Paige Bueckers in a campaign.</span></p><p data-mce-fragment=1><span data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">More money came streaming when he entered his last year with Dan Hurley as Clingan was emerging as one of the<a href=#> best prospects in the 2024 NBA Draft.</a> Companies like Bleeding Blue for Good and Stephen Toyota got him as an endorser during the regular seas.</span></p><p data-mce-fragment=1><span data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Madness then came when the calendar turned to March. It was expected by many that UConn would make it far into the NCAA Tournament which is why Clingan was such a desirable prospect to invest on. RITZ Crackers, Skims, The NIL Store, Breaking T, and Barstool Sports rode his popularity en route to their back-to-back national championship win.</span></p><p data-mce-fragment=1><span data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">These deals that were inked late in his college career saw him work with the likes of Kim Kardashian and other college stars in Armando Bacot, Hunter Dickinson, and Caleb Love among others. Sky is now the limit with the endorsements he can sign with the Trail Blazers. Hopefully, his championship-winning acumen translates in the NBA such that he could notch bigger sponsorships as his career evolves.</span></p><p data-mce-fragment=1><span data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Clingan and the Trail Blazers will start their NBA Summer League off against the San Antonio Spurs and Philadelphia 76ers. He will surely be a threat on the boards and off pick-and-roll actions.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfmbyvu9WapWabnJ67qK3NrGSnoZxiw6K41J5kmqxdqrCwus1mmZ6en6eybrbOoqWippdiwbOtyKVkm6SRr7Kzvw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brianna-coppage-leaked-video-and-photo-is-she-fired.html><span>←</span><span>Brianna Coppage Leaked Video And Photo: Is She Fired?</span></a>
