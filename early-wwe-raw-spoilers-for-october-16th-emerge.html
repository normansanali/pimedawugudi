We will have to see what else comes out before the show, but it appears that they have some building to do.</p><p>The bona fide WWE insider noted that, “Sami Zayn will not have a good night. His story starts strong.” Only time will tell what WWE does with Sami Zayn following Kevin Owens’ trade to SmackDown.</p><p>The spoiler posts also noted that, Becky Lynch will “find herself in front of the new acquisition.” As NXT Women’s Champion, she is certainly a fighting champion. The Man is also prone to bring her title along with her on RAW.</p><p>WWE’s ‘season premiere’ of Monday Night RAW airs tonight on the USA Network and brings with it two title matches. The card for the evening is already set to include the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship bout, where Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso defend their title against Damian Priest and Finn Balor. Additionally, GUNTHER puts his Intercontinental Championship on the line against Bronson Reed.</p><p>The night will also feature a Falls Count Anywhere match between Ricochet and Shinsuke Nakamura, Rhea Ripley taking on Shayna Baszler, and a clash between Piper Niven and Natalya.</p><p>We will have more coverage of WWE RAW, right before the show, and even afterward, right here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.
