On 9 February 2016, Isy proposed to her man at a launch party for her new book. They were at the Westow House pub in Crystal Palace after her appearance at the Bookseller Crow. They made the engagement official on Elis James’s Radio X show with&nbsp;John Robins, as they played a recording of the moment.</p><p>As opposed to their relationship taking a big step, Isy’s memoir, The Actual One, unraveled her struggle not to settle down while her friends get married and have children.</p><p>The recording starts with Robins standing on a chair, tapping a glass, and announcing ‘Isy would like to say a few words and see how it goes …’ A clearly emotional Suttie can be heard thanking her friends for coming before saying to James: ‘I love you. Will you marry me?’</p><p>Elis admitted, “Because she said, “Elis I love you” and I thought yeah, she’s going to thank Rupert her publisher, b) her editor in a minute, and… oh wow!”</p><p>He continued, “And obviously, amazing woman and all that sorts of stuff. But the stand-up comic in me did think “oh, if I made a joke now, as long as I read the vibe right, it would be very, very, very funny”. But then I looked at everyone’s expectant eyes and I looked at Isy and I thought, “This is probably not the time to start riffing.”</p><p>Isy told <a href=#>Chortle</a>: “Once someone’s watched you give birth, it seems only natural that the next step is bickering over vol a vent flavor and whether Manic Street Preachers can work for a first dance. I’m very very happy to finally be making an honest man of Elis”.</p><p>She is now married to Elis James.</p><p>Isy spoke fondly about the proposal during an interview with The Guardian. She said: “I’d had a tequila. Before my dad died, Elis had asked his permission to marry me, which was amazing, but then never produced a ring or officially proposed. So it was less of a bolt from the blue and more of a kick up the bum. We still haven’t got married, though. We’re about to spend the wedding money on two nights at Center Parcs”.</p><p>Two of them shared two children: the oldest daughter named Beti, born in 2014, and a son named Steffan, born in 2019.</p><p>Isy Suttie is a stand-up comedian and actor who is most known for her role as Dobby on Peep Show.
