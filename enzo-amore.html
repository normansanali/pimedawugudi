He had trained with Joe DeFranco at the DeFranco’s Training Systems gym in Wyckoff, New Jersey since the age of 16. By chance, WWE executive Triple H also started training with DeFranco; Arndt, a lifelong fan of professional wrestling, made a compilation video of himself doing various exercises and cutting a promo. When DeFranco showed the video to Triple H, Arndt was given a tryout at WWE, ultimately resulting in his signing. In August 2012, WWE signed Arndt, who then started using the ring name Eric Anthony. In November 2012, he was given the ring name of Enzo Amore when he debuted in WWE’s developmental system NXT as a wrestler.</p><p align=justify>He was raised at Hackensack as well as Waldwick, New Jersey.&nbsp;He has been in relationships with other WWE star&nbsp;He spent his early years in Hackensack and Waldwick, New Jersey.

On the July 3 episode of NXT, Amore went on to form an alliance with Colin Cassady, who had also lost to Ryan, and they named themselves “the realest guys in the room”. Despite Amore and Cassady’s alliance, Ryan easily defeated them in consecutive singles matches in July, but lost to them in a handicap match. After the feud with Ryan, Amore and Cassady went on to feud with Alexander Rusev, Scott Dawson and their manager Sylvester Lefort, turning face in the process. On the September 25 episode of NXT, Amore and Cassady participated in a gauntlet match for a future shot at the NXT Tag Team Championship; they started the match, first defeating CJ Parker and Tyler Breeze, then defeating Rusev and Dawson but lost to The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor). In November 2013, Amore suffered a broken leg while training. According to fellow wrestler Simon Gotch, who at the time was also signed to NXT, Amore “broke his own leg trying to counter a wristlock. He blamed it on the canvas being loose.”</p><p>In WWE, he came to prominence for his partnership with Big Cass, whom he teamed with from 2013 to 2017. Together, they won the NXT Year-End Award for Tag Team of the Year in 2015. He was later moved to the 205 Live brand, where he was a two-time Cruiserweight Champion. Since leaving WWE, he has also embarked on a rap music career initially under the name Real1, but now goes under the same name he uses on the independent circuit.</p><h2>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h2><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Enzo Amore ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>On the August 22 episode of 205 Live, Amore debuted in the cruiserweight division and began a feud with Cruiserweight Champion Neville. On the September 5 episode of 205 Live, Amore earned a title opportunity against Neville, winning a Fatal five-way elimination match also involving Cedric Alexander, The Brian Kendrick, Gran Metalik and Tony Nese. At No Mercy on September 24, Amore defeated Neville with a low blow to win the Cruiserweight Championship. This decision was made because of 205 Live’s lack of success; Vince McMahon thought a “strong” character as Amore would improve the brand, making him the core of the show. The following night on Raw, Amore closed the show with a “championship celebration”, where he insulted the cruiserweight division and stated that he made 205 Live “relevant” and that the 205 Live roster was “jealous” of his accomplishments, turning heel for the first time since 2013. He also showed a signed clause by General Manager Kurt Angle that if any cruiserweight touched him, they would lose their title opportunities. The week after on Raw, Amore revealed another paper clause stating that any cruiserweight that tried to touch him would be fired. Subsequently, Kalisto was introduced as the newest member of the cruiserweight division and attacked Amore. On the October 9 episode of Raw, Amore lost the Cruiserweight Championship to Kalisto in a lumberjack match. However, he regained the title in the rematch at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on October 22, via an illegal thumb shot to the eye behind the referee’s back. At the Survivor Series pre-show on November 19, Amore successfully defended the title against Kalisto. This was his last WWE pay-per-view appearance. In early January 2018, Amore was unable to compete due to suffering from influenza.</p><h2>Who is Enzo Amore Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Enzo Amore</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

In early August, Amore and Cassady participated in the NXT Tag Team Championship tournament. They defeated Jason Jordan and Tye Dillinger in the first round, but were eliminated by The Vaudevillains (Aiden English and Simon Gotch) in the second round. Lefort and Louis then renewed their rivalry with Amore and Cassady by attacking them and shaving Amore’s beard. As a result, Amore challenged Lefort to a match with the loser’s hair as forfeit at NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way which Amore won, but Lefort ran away, leaving his partner Louis to lose his hair and eyebrows. Amore and Cassady then formed an alliance with the debuting Carmella. The duo had accidentally cost Carmella her hairdressing job, causing her to demand to get a job as a wrestler. Carmella had her televised in-ring debut on the October 16, 2014 episode of NXT. On the March 11, 2015 episode of NXT, Amore and Cassady defeated The Lucha Dragons to become the number one contenders for the NXT Tag Team Championship. At NXT TakeOver: Unstoppable, Amore and Cassady faced Blake and Murphy for the title in a losing effort after interference from Alexa Bliss. In December, Amore and Cassady began a feud with Dash and Dawson, where they challenged them for the NXT Tag Team Championship at both NXT TakeOver: London and Roadblock unsuccessfully.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Enzo Amore height</b> <strong>5 ft 11 in</strong> Enzo <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 11 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Before their employment with WWE, Arndt met William Morrissey, while playing basketball together at the Cage of Manhattan, New York nearly ten years before reuniting on NXT in July 2013. Arndt’s decade-and-a-half long friendship with him ended in August 2017 after Arndt publicly criticized Morrissey for not finishing their August 21 match after injuring his knee. The two have since reconciled.</p><p align=justify>On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Enzo and Cass were drafted to the Raw brand. Enzo and Cass then proceeded to feud with Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens, which culminated at SummerSlam, where the two lost to Jericho and Owens. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Enzo and Cass joined Team Raw for the Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match at Survivor Series, during which Team Raw defeated Team SmackDown. On the November 21 episode of Raw, after Amore was locked out of the locker room naked by Cass as a practical joke and ran into Lana in the hallway, her husband Rusev challenged Amore to a match later that night, in which Amore was quickly defeated. On the December 5 episode of Raw, after Amore stood up for Lana after seeing her and Rusev argue backstage, Lana invited Amore to her hotel room. Later that night, this was revealed to be a trap when Rusev attacked Amore in the hotel room. Over the following weeks, Enzo and Cass feuded with Rusev and Jinder Mahal. On January 29, 2017, Amore participated in the Royal Rumble match, entering at number 27 but was eliminated by Brock Lesnar. At WrestleMania 33, Enzo and Cass competed in a fatal-four-way ladder match for the Raw Tag Team Championship against defending champions Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, Cesaro and Sheamus, and the returning The Hardy Boyz, where The Hardy Boyz emerged victorious. The following night on Raw, Amore and Cass were defeated by Cesaro and Sheamus in a tag team match to determinate the number one contenders for the Raw Tag Team Championship.</p><h2>Top Facts about Enzo Amore</h2><li>Enzo Amore is an American professional wrestler and rapper.</li><li>He was born on December 8, 1986 in Hackensack, New Jersey.</li><li>His real name is Eric Arndt.</li><li>Amore began his wrestling career in 2012 with WWE.</li><li>He won the NXT Tag Team Championship twice with Big Cass.</li><li>In 2017, he was released from WWE due to misconduct allegations.</li><li>Amore released a rap album titled “Rosemary’s Baby Pt. 1: Happy Birthday” in 2020.</li><li>He has over 800k followers on Instagram as of August 2021.</li><li>Amore stands at a height of 5 feet and 11 inches (180 cm).</li><li>His finishing move is called the “JawdonZo”.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Enzo Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Wrestler</strong>.
