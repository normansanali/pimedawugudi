It’s the way I was brought up, and it’s the way I brought up my kids.</p><p>The couple who married in 1977&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">raised</a>&nbsp;their children away from the spotlight. Despite their desire to provide a normal upbringing for their children, the brother-sister pair eventually pursued their dreams of becoming celebrities following their father’s footsteps. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Schitt’s Creek won a slew of Emmys, a <a href=# rel=follow>Golden Globe</a>, among many other awards over the course of the show’s six seasons. Eugene shared his experiences of performing alongside his children on stage during the Emmy Awards in September 2020.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>He said getting to work on camera with both of his children for six years has been such a joy. “I love you both and could not be prouder,” he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Sarah impressed the viewers as Twyla Sands, the hapless resident server in&nbsp;Schitt’s Creek, despite not being a member of the main cast like her father and brother.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So, what is Sarah’s backstory? Let’s look at what we’ve got.</p><h2>Sarah Is the Second Child of Eugene and Deborah</h2><p>Born on September 10, 1986, Sarah is Eugene and Deborah’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">youngest</a> child. The brunette beauty was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada before moving to the United States to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.</p><h2>A Trained Actress&nbsp;</h2><p>Although Sarah’s brother Daniel had a reputation in the Hollywood industry before his sister — most successful as a Canadian television personality for shows like Canada’s MTV Live — Sarah was more classically <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">trained</a> in acting, studying theater at Dalhousie University. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Sarah Received Enormous Acclaim for Her Role as Twyla on ‘Schitt’s&nbsp;Creek’</h2><p>Though the actress had minor roles in films since 2011, it wasn’t until Schitt’s Creek (2015) that she got her breakthrough.&nbsp;</p><p>The viewers have always wondered why Sarah was cast as the resident millionaire waitress Twyla Sands, rather than as a member of the show’s central Rose family, alongside her father and brother as the sitcom was created by Eugene and Daniel.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, the actress could comment on the popularity of the part she played for the entire six-season run of Schitt’s Creek, even calling it a “perk.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In a 2017 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Hello!, she explained when the show first came out, everyone assumed she was the sister [Alexis Rose], but people didn’t know that she was related to Eugene and Daniel as she could do her own thing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actress had also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">won</a>&nbsp;the Screen Actors Guild Awards 2021 for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series and IGN Summer Movie Awards 2020 for Best TV Ensemble for her role in Schitt’s Creek.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Acting Credits</h2><p>Aside from her most notable role as Twyla Sands on Schitt’s Creek from 2015 to 2020, she has many other projects credited to her name.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Sarah made her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">acting debut</a> in the action-crime film XIII: The Series, playing the title role of the librarian in 2011. The same year, she appeared in the comedy-drama Larry Crowne,&nbsp;in 2011 where she played the role of Elli.</p><p>She has Ali played minor roles in projects like The Applicant (2012), Roomies (2013), Working the Engels (2014), The Winner Mindset (2019), United We Fall (2020), All Rise (2021), and many more.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>In a Relationship with Graham Outerbridge</h2><p>Sarah, like her father, is in a committed relationship. The actress is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating</a>&nbsp;Agents of S.H.E.I.L.D. actor Graham Outerbridge and their relationship dates back to at least May 2018, when she&nbsp;first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appeared</a>&nbsp;on Outerbridge’s Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5rCqLHNnmSlnaaueqWt1KCfrZ2iYrCptcudqZ6mXaius63HZqOerqljtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./magicians-recap-season-1-episode-6-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Magicians Recap: Is Anyone Watching?</span></a>
