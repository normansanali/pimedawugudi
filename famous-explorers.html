It was referred to as Ocean Sea, but as the world would soon discover, it was not the only ocean in existence.</p><p>Magellan spent more than a month traveling through the strait before reaching its end. Although he and his crew expected to see land from afar on the other side, to Magellan’s surprise he found another vast ocean before him. The only thing to do was to cross it.</p><p>Magellan and his crew eventually reached the Philippines, but they were not welcomed with open arms. On the island of Cebu, Magellan would up befriending the locals, who he asked to assist them when the neighboring island of&nbsp;Mactan attacked their fleet.</p><p>The famous explorer Magellan, unfortunately, was shot during a battle with the people of&nbsp;Mactan, and he died on April 27, 1521.</p><p>Although he’d never reach the spice islands, Magellan’s courageous journey would become instrumental in understanding what the globe looked like.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonynrcyorKxlla29rbvRnqmsZ2Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./exploring-historic-maui-new-book-tells-story-of-island-towns.html><span>←</span><span>Exploring Historic Maui: New book tells story of island towns | News, Sports, Jobs</span></a>
