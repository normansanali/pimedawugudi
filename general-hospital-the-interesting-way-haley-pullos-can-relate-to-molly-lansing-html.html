As the daughter of Alexis Davis and Ric Lansing, she is a member of both the Corinthos and Cassadine families. The character has two half-sisters, Kristina Davis and Sam McCall, who are both her older siblings through her Alexis.</p><p id=par-3_83>During the time when Molly was first rapidly aged on the show and Pullos assumed the role, most of her storylines were intertwined with those of her Kristina, as well as her cousins Michael and Morgan Corinthos (who also happened to be are brothers of Kristina). However, this takes a turn in her later years, she begins dating her close friend, T.J. Ashford. Pullos was once a contract cast member but has been appearing on a recurring basis during the last several years.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_48>Aside from her work on General Hospital,&nbsp;Pullos recurred on Nick-at-Nite’s&nbsp;Instant Mom.&nbsp;She has also appeared in television films like&nbsp;From Straight A’s to XXX&nbsp;and&nbsp;A Royal Christmas Ball, and guest-starred on television shows like&nbsp;Scorpion&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Mick.

I am originally from the [San Francisco] Bay Area and my parents moved out with me, but all of my siblings stayed up north. And now, I’m the only one left here!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_39>She’s the only one left in Los Angeles because as she became an adult, her parents decided to leave the city.
