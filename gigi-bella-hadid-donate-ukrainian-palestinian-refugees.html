May we all see each other as brothers and sisters, beyond politics, beyond race, beyond religion. At the the end of the day, innocent lives pay for war- not leaders. HANDS OFF UKRAINE. HANDS OFF PALESTINE. PEACE. PEACE. PEACE," she wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bella followed, saying in a post Wednesday that Gigi inspired her to donate "her fashion month earnings directly to organizations that are providing help, refuge and medical aide to those in need on the ground in Ukraine, as well as continuing to support our Palestinian people and land."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Many quickly accused the sisters of being anti-Semitic for standing up for Palestine. Gigi denied that assumption in a statement Wednesday, and noted that anti-Palestinianism exists too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Cambridge University defines ‘anti-Palestinianism’ as: 'Prejudice, hostility or discrimination against Palestinians; Denial of the Nakba; Accusing a Palestinian of 'latent' racism(s) without cause; Allowing Palestinian exception to all other held liberal or left values/politics,'" she wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her father, Mohamed Hadid, showed his supporting by reposting the comment <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca6nDcWrAZ-/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="on his own Instagram" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">on his own Instagram</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"A refugee crisis is a refugee crisis," Gigi continued in her statement, which she shared on her Instagram Story. "This is not anti-anything except anti-human suffering and anti-war. If you believe any person or child, anywhere, born or growing up in the many places where there is a refugee crisis, doesn’t deserve this assistance, you are focused on the wrong part. These children don’t choose a side in politics - they are born and raised in this and deserve, at the bare minimum, a decent life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because Gigi and Bella are of Palestinian-Dutch heritage (their father was born into a Palestinian Muslim family), they often speak openly of the issue and send help to Palestinians in need.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"While my dad is a Palestinian refugee who was able to make a life for himself in the United States after being born in Nazareth, there are currently over five million Palestinians living in refugee camps still," Gigi wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The model and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39047390/gigi-hadid-baby-khai-style-photo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="girl mom" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">girl mom</a> said she will be donating to UNICEF in Ukraine and Palestine, "both war-torn countries." She has worked with the humanitarian aid organization before, and even visited the largest refugee camp in the world, Kutupalong, located in the coastal district of Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, which houses thousands of predominantly Rohingya refugees who have fled Myanmar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gigi noted that UNICEF provides services catered to the needs of each region and crisis. Currently in Ukraine, she said their priority is to meet the growing needs of children and families. In Palestine this year, she said the organization is working to ensure thousands of people have access to clean water, and health care, and children have access to mental health care and education.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.unicefusa.org/supporters/celebrities/ambassadors data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="UNICEF's website" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">UNICEF's website</a>, Gigi is listed as one of the celebrity supporters, along with Selena Gomez, Heidi Klum, Billie Eilish, Alyssa Milano, and Naomi Osaka, among others.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gigi and Bella's younger brother, Anwar Hadid, reposted Gigi's latest statement on his Instagram Story, as did their elder sister Alana Hadid. Following the criticism of Gigi and Bella, Alana <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca5O4L7PMUA/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shared her own statement" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">shared her own statement</a>, calling for peace. "It only benefits the powers that be for us to see ourselves as separate," she wrote on Instagram. "We are all humans, suffering, loving and living the human experience. When we realize our similarities instead of arguing our differences the powers who seek to separate us lose! Peace benefits the many. War benefits the few." The eldest Hadid sister, Marielle Hadid, re-posted Alana's statement on her Instagram Story.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
