What does Pedro Pascal smell like?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>What I love about this interview is the sheer amount of candor on screen. So when it came to dissecting scent, Ramsey didn’t hold anything back. Good on you, Bella.</p><p>“This is an intersting question. He smells great. He always says that my hair smells nice. I’m fully making it about me. He smells great, and he always worries that he smells bad, but he never does.”</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>I knew it. I knew Pedro Pascal didn’t smell. How could he? Awesome people don’t smell. Okay, well that’s not entirely true. Everyone smells. Still, if you’re a cool person you should get a pass.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>Thankfully the description didn’t stop with the word great. Instead, Ramsey dug right into exactly how Pedro Pascal smells.</p><p>“I feel like I should describe how he smells, but he’s indescribable. Actually, his jacket that he wore as Joel. He’s in a leather jacket a lot of the time, and that was his smell for me. Because there was one time the (Pedro’s) stunt double would be sitting there in his coat, and I would be like — it smells like him.”</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>That’s right. Pedro Pascal smells like leather. Which I don’t want to imagine too deeply because everyone deserves their privacy. Sitting around too long and thinking about what celebrities might smell like is a slippery slope. So let’s quit while we’re ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1pnnApa6asaNiwam1zaSqZqCVYsCusculqmaakZl6o8HTZp%2BeZZ6aw6a%2BjJ2mnqtdl7KtuMBmqZqlo5rGbrvNZqeenKKkerGt0pyYpatdo7yvsdeiqq2dnql6tMDAp6Jo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-rock-girlfriend-4783848.html><span>←</span><span>Everything To Know About His Dating History Hollywood Life</span></a>
