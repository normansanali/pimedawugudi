However, the Military Police Brigade found it out and killed them as they were trying to escape with their device.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_killed_Armin%E2%80%99s_parents></span><strong>Who killed Armin’s parents?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to the new publication, Armin’s parents were actually killed by the military police after the pair tried to leave Marley’s walls via an air balloon. The booklet says Djel Sannes was the man who killed the couple during their escape attempt.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Zeke_Yeager_have_a_son></span><strong>Does Zeke Yeager have a son?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zeke was the son of Grisha Yeager and Dina Fritz, the older half-brother of Eren Yeager, and a member of the royal family from his mother’s side.</p><p>Chapter.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Beast Titans</th></tr><tr><td>Tom Ksaver (829-842)</td><td>Zeke Yeager (842-854)</td><td>Unknown (854)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Armin%E2%80%99s_mom></span><strong>Who is Armin’s mom?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chapter.

But this “Erwin is Armin’s father” is baseless to me. But even if it hadn’t been confirmed, this theory is incredibly illogical. I don’t know how its supporters can think that neither Armin nor Erwin would be able to recognize each other when Armin joined the Survey Corps.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Levi_and_Mikasa_related></span><strong>Is Levi and Mikasa related?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>They indeed are cousins and one of them will become a titan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Eren%E2%80%99s_wife></span><strong>Who is Eren’s wife?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dina Yeager | Villains Wiki | Fandom.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Zeke_a_double_agent></span><strong>Was Zeke a double agent?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The younger soldiers had thought the Beast Titan was killed by Levi during the battle, but it seems that was a ruse. Instead, Zeke was taken up to the airship being used for evacuation, and he didn’t come alone. Back in Marley, the Cart Titan revealed the other double agent working beside Zeke.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_was_the_titan_that_ate_Zeke></span><strong>Who was the titan that ate Zeke?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Based on images seen previously in textbooks and such, this girl is Ymir Fritz, the mysterious originator of the Titan power.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Yelena_AOT></span><strong>How old is Yelena AOT?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Attack On Titan Statistics Chart</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Character</th><th>Age</th><th>Height</th></tr><tr><td>Kenny Ackerman</td><td>40-45⁶</td><td>6’3″ / 190cm</td></tr><tr><td>Yelena</td><td>N/A</td><td>6’3″ / 190cm</td></tr><tr><td>Gabi Braun</td><td>12⁵</td><td>4’6″ / 138cm</td></tr><tr><td>Porco Galliard</td><td>N/A⁵</td><td>5’8″ / 175cm</td></tr></tbody></table><p>• Mar 21, 2022</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_gave_Armin_the_hat></span><strong>Who gave Armin the hat?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>104th Training Corps arc</p><p>When Shadis asks him if his parents gave him the name Armin replies that it was given to him by his grandfather.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_was_Erwin%E2%80%99s_dad_theory></span><strong>What was Erwin’s dad theory?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He believed that it was near impossible for humanity not to have passed down an oral history. Instead, the only way to ensure that humanity forgot about the history before the Walls would be to alter their memory in some way.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_was_Erwin%E2%80%99s_dad_killed></span><strong>Why was Erwin’s dad killed?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As the third season of the series shifts toward a bleaker tone, focusing more on the humanity of its characters, fans were also introduced to Erwin’s tragic past as his father was killed for knowing too much.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_next_commander_after_hange_Zoe></span><strong>Who is the next commander after hange Zoe?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After being promoted to commander, Hange was also in charge of expedition planning, management of the regiment, recruiting, and all the other responsibilities previously handled by Erwin. Upon their death, they were succeeded by Armin Arlert.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Levi%E2%80%99s_dad></span><strong>Who is Levi’s dad?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rod Reiss!!

Levi’s loyalty and devotion to Erwin also indicate that the two were meant to be together.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_did_Mikasa_marry></span><strong>Who did Mikasa marry?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Attack on Titan Episode 84 reimagines Jean and Mikasa’s married life in a short bittersweet dream.

Upset by the betrayal, Zeke swore to save Eren from their father’s brainwashing, but it seems he did not need to. It turns out Grisha never brainwashed Eren; If anything, it was Eren who brainwashed his dad.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Zeke_have_royal_blood></span><strong>Does Zeke have royal blood?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zeke does have royal blood, as his mother was Dina Fritz. However, as he’s not seen as a direct descendant, his powers are limited. He can turn people into titans but only if they had some of his spinal fluid first.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Zeke_betray_his_parents></span><strong>Why Zeke betray his parents?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thus, long story short, Zeke betrayed his parents to keep himself and his granparents safe from becoming a mindless Titan. He realised that the Marleyan authorities were closing in on the restorationists. And according to Tom there was no other way to save his grandparents, whom he loved more than his parents.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_strongest_Titan></span>Who is the strongest Titan?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>1) Founding Titan</p><p>This Titan was used by Karl Fritz, Ymir Fritz, Frieda Reiss, Uri Reiss, Grisha Yeager, and Eren Jaeger. This is the most powerful Titan of the lot.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Eren_betray_Zeke></span><strong>Why did Eren betray Zeke?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Why did Eren betray Zeke in Attack on Titan episode 78? To put it simply, Eren betrayed Zeke because he is not in support of their plans to euthanise every Eldian on the planet until the end of time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_kind_of_Titan_is_Rod_Reiss></span><strong>What kind of Titan is Rod Reiss?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rod was transformed into a Pure Titan, which is different from a Titan shifter and does not have its own will or thought. Much like the typical mindless Titans but Rod would go under the Abnormal Titan type which is an uncommon type of Pure Titan which we see few of throughout the series.</p><h2><strong></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ktbDDjJ2gnWWRp7qqutJmp5qqlaPBtHnDopxmmZ6euqZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gabi-coccio-net-worth-146223.html><span>←</span><span>Gabi Coccio Net Worth</span></a>
