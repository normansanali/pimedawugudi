Her career, earnings, and the recent developments surrounding her detainment in Russia have garnered significant attention. This article delves into the detailed analysis of Brittney Griner's earnings, including her net worth, WNBA salary, career earnings, and the influence of playing overseas on her income.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Brittney Griner's Net Worth</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=#>Brittney Griner</a> has an estimated net worth of $5 million.

She signed a one-year contract worth $165,100 with the Phoenix Mercury for the 2023-24 season. Notably, during her detainment in Russia, the WNBA ensured that she received her full salary of nearly $228,000 for the 2022 season, which was the final year of a lucrative three-year, $644,544 contract. This contract marked a significant pay increase for Griner. However, her WNBA salary paled in comparison to the substantial earnings she received while playing for UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia, where her annual salary was believed to be around $1 million.
