The former child star also noted to guest <a href=#><strong>Anna Faris</strong></a> that she’s ashamed of her past work.</p><p class=p1>“I quit a few years ago because I initially didn’t want to do it,” the Nickelodeon alum said. “I’m so ashamed of the parts I’ve done in the past. … I resent my career in a lot of ways. I feel so unfulfilled by the roles that I played and felt like it was the most cheesy, embarrassing [thing].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iCarly-Jennette-McCurdy-Ashamed-Her-Past-Acting-Work-001.jpg><p class=p1>McCurdy starred alongside <a href=#><strong>Miranda Cosgrove</strong></a> on Nickelodeon’s hit show iCarly, which ran for six seasons from 2007 to 2012, before receiving her own spinoff, Sam & Cat, with <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande.</strong></a> She then starred in the Netflix series Between before embarking on a short-lived country music career.</p><p class=p1>“I did the shows that I was on from like 13 to 21, and by 15, I was already embarrassed,” McCurdy told the&nbsp;Scary Movie&nbsp;actress, 44. “My friends at 15 weren’t like ‘Oh, cool, you’re on this Nickelodeon show.’ It was embarrassing. I imagine there’s a very different experience to be had with acting if you’re proud of your roles.”</p><p class=p1>The podcast host got her start in the industry at age 6 after a push from her mother, Debra McCurdy, and ultimately quit after Debra passed away in 2013. While Jennette was acting, she was her family’s main financial support.</p><p class=p1>“With her death kind of died a lot of ideas for my life, and that was its own journey — and a difficult one for sure,” the former actress said. She is now trying her hand at writing and directing and said the work is “going great.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iCarly-Jennette-McCurdy-Ashamed-Her-Past-Acting-Work-002.jpg><p class=p1>In December 2020, <a href=#>it was announced</a> that an iCarly reboot is coming to Paramount+. While most of the show’s original cast is set to return, McCurdy is not included on the list.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;House Bunny&nbsp;star did ask McCurdy if there’s anything that would make her return to acting, and the writer pointed out that she made a comeback in 2020 for her one-woman show I’m Glad My Mom Died. “I really didn’t want to,” McCurdy said. “That [show] would be the most of it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaim5Gnubq%2FjKOcp6aVqcGmecycmq6qlK56qr%2BMmqqhmZ2asW67xWafnqpdpa60wIyamq2hnpx6uLvRpGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-soul-death.html><span>←</span><span>Hutch &amp;amp; Starsky Actor David Soul Death: David Soul Death Cause Cancer, How Did David Soul Die?</span></a>
