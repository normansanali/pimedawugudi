After adding that “Elastigirl is our best play,” Bob — also known as Mr. Incredible (<strong>Craig T. Nelson</strong>) — raises his eyebrows to ask, “Better than me?”</p><p>The trailer then cuts to the second story line where Mr. Incredible is struggling to keep things in order with kids Dash, Violet and Jack-Jack. He can be seen dealing with a frustrated teenager, battling sleepless nights and even trying to conquer middle school math.</p><p>While working with Dash, a visibly annoyed Mr. Incredible tries to solve math homework, just to realize it’s different from back when he was in school. “I don’t know that way!

The youngest member of the Parr family shows that he’s not yet in control of his powers, but with a good cookie bribe, he returns to normal.</p><p>The end of the trailer shows a disheartened Mrs. Incredible venting to her husband. “You know what’s crazy right? To help my family, I have to leave it, and to fix the law, I’ve got to break it,” she says, to which he responds, “You’ve got to, so our kids can have that choice.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/the-incredibles-elastigirl.jpg><p>It’s clear that the Incredibles are back and better than ever, ready to battle the stigma around superheros.</p><p>Incredibles 2 is set to his theaters on June 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCnm6Kasaquy56qZmpdqb%2BitcueqWadnJbAtbXGoqmlZaSWuKa%2FjKilZpldo7K4ecmomWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-danny-adcock-wife-details-to-know-about-the-actor.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Danny Adcock Wife?
