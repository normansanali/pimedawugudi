Since then Hartwell has also been competing in tag team matches often.</p><p>While speaking to Fightful, Indi Hartell revealed that she was called up for a dark match on the main roster. It turned into two dark matches, where Hartwell revealed that she got a positive response. Due to this, she is hopeful about getting a main roster call-up in the future.</p><p>“I didn’t really think I was getting called up because the dark match kinda of came out of nowhere. I got told the night before I had to fly out. I think it was because someone got injured and I was basically filling in for them. One dark match turned into two dark matches, which I felt like was a good sign and I got really good feedback, had an amazing experience there, and I left both of those matches feeling really good. Hopefully, when the time comes for me to get called up, I’m well-prepared for it.”</p><p>Indi Hartwell&nbsp;partnered up with Persia Pirotta in a Triple Threat Ladder Match at Halloween Havoc for the NXT Women’s Tag Team Titles. They were unable to win the match, but certainly made a great impression on the crowd. We will have to wait and see if Hartwell will eventually be called up to the main roster or not.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
