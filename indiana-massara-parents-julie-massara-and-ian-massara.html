In the rest of the writing though, we are going to talk about an altogether different topic, about Indiana’s parents. So, stay tuned!</span></p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Who Are Indiana Massara’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>On 23 August 2002, Indiana, full name Indiana Marie Ella Massara, was born to a wonderful pair of parents. In 2023, as the same young Indiana turned 21 years old, it’s high time we tell you about the ones who birthed her and gave her life so wonderful.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Julie Massara, Indiana Massara Mother</strong></h3><p>Every now and then, Indiana Massara discusses her beautiful mother Julie Massara on social media. One time for instance, she posted a ‘throwback’ picture of them together and next to it teasingly wrote, “A throwback to when my mum wasn’t mad at me for a messy room… let’s hope she still loves me😂🙈 UPDATE: votes to be forgiven Indi 12 v Julie 1👏🏻👏🏻 #tbt.”</p><p>So, Indiana’s mom is the daughter of Cheryl Smith, a former John Forrest Senior High School alum, and WA College of Agriculture alum Darryl Smith. It is not clear though if these folks from Mandurah, Western Australia are still together because John not long ago updated his status on FB as “Got married on 6 September 2022.”</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Julie Massara Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>She was born as ‘Julie Marie Massara’ on 18 October 1970. So, she turned 52 years old in 2022.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Julie Massara Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Both of Indiana’s parents are into the mining business. According to&nbsp;businessnews.com, following several years of detailed research into the mining services industry, Julie and her husband Ian made the entrepreneurial decision to sell their house to finance the building of Australian Mining Services. It also explained that Julie, through offering superior technical innovation, quick friendly customer care, and meticulous office controls, was able to gain confidence and business with several large multi-national clients.

That includes her choice of profession. Every time, Indiana comes with a new single/album it is Ian who first raves about it among his people. He also talks about it on social media. In January 2018, when the single “Smoke In Your Eyes” was out, he took to his FB to gush that he was so proud of how hard his daughter worked to make this happen. He did something similar when “Say It Back” dropped in October 2019.</p><p>Indiana too can be often seen featuring her dad on her own social media posts, even more on occasions like Father’s Day. She loves to refer to him as her “OG”.</p><p>You might also want to know that Ian has a bunch of siblings named Terry Massara, Brian Massara, Kevin Lisa Massara Boomer, and Margaret Hansen.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Ian Massara Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ian Massara was reportedly born before 1968.

Since January 2011, he has been self-employed and provided consultant services in the mining industry to major clients from Australia, China, the USA, Chile, Denmark, and Indonesia.</p><p>When Ian gets some time to himself from all that, he loves going on rides. Even better, he does that with the purpose of fundraising to support projects like cancer research. Back in November 2022, for instance, it was his 3rd year riding to beat cancer. Also, at that time, he had promised that he would be taking a stand against cancer and backing the brilliant brains at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research in 2023.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Is Ian Massara On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Indeed, Ian Massara was discoverable on Instagram.
