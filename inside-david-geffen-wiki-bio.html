David comes from humble backgrounds, his father Abraham Geffen, was a scholar, and his mother Batya, a corset maker. Both his parents were Jewish immigrants making David and his brother Mitchell second-generation Americans. After passing his matriculation from the New Utrecht High School in 1960, David enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. After a year at Austin, David moved to Brooklyn College but dropped out once more. After moving to LA, David attended the Santa Monica College but couldn’t stay there either.</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Professional Career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>David began his career in the mail-room of the William Morris Agency. To land the job, David lied on his resume stating he graduated from UCLA. When letters eventually came from UCLA denying his claims, David modified the letters and started working as a talent agent. David later left WMA and started working as a personal manager. He quickly found work with Laura Nyro and Crosby, and Stills and Nash.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Inspired by his success, David opened Asylum Records in 1971 with Elliot Roberts. Their first signing was a young Jackson Browne. Distributed by Atlantic Records, Asylum records quickly became a safe haven for artists unable to find deals. In the years that followed David signed deals with the Eagles, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Linda Ronstadt, Warren Zevon, Judee Sill, and J.D. Souther. David left Asylum records in the late 1970’s and started working as vice chairman of Warner Bros. film studios. After retiring in 1977, David took a non-credit class at Yale that lasted until 1979.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/website-67.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After getting a second diagnosis for his presumed cancer, David was declared healthy.

The billionaire came out way back in 1992, at a time when gay marriage was yet to be legalized by law. In 2006, David began dating Jeremy Lingvall. Jeremy who was a college student was 41 years younger than David. The relationship ran out of stem in 2012 and in the same year David was seen kissing ex-college football player Jamie Kuntz. The pair denied claims of relationship but Jamie continued to stalk David which led him to file a restraining order against Jamie. Jamie was arrested in 2014 for violating the order.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/website-65.jpg><p>It is reported that David has recently tied the knot with his much younger partner, Donovan Michaels, in a secret ceremony.&nbsp;The 80-year-old exchanged vows with the 30-year-old former go-go dancer, with only two other couples as witnesses.
