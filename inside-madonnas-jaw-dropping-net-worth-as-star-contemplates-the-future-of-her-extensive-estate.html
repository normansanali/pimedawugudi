With a glittering career spanning four decades, she has claimed the title of Forbes' top-earning female musician a staggering 11 times, amassing a vast fortune of $850 million and selling more than 300 million records worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p id=elQJJqM4otv data-wc=25>Now, in light of recent health concerns, the pop icon has reportedly begun to contemplate her remarkable legacy and the future of her extensive estate.</p><p id=edk-Cu3Y3su data-wc=41>The 64-year-old artist was hospitalized recently, found unconscious and in the <a class=hm-link href=#>throes of a severe bacterial infection</a>. Today, she's well on the road to recovery, even being spotted last weekend enjoying a leisurely stroll in New York City's Upper East Side.&nbsp;</p><p id=eODbyBE8AzK data-wc=24>However, the health scare has forced the postponement of her forthcoming Celebrations tour and provoked serious reflection about the handling of her iconic legacy.</p><p id=e_z3EyymKen data-wc=35>Madonna, mother to Lourdes 26, Rocco 22, David 17, Mercy James, 16, and 10-year-old twins Estere and Stelle, is said to be planning to divide the rights to her songs equally among her six children.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aa73b114f737-3585207383076046282808989009832377634927547n.jpg><p id=e4rXtb4yxfL data-wc=17>This decision appears to be a bid to preempt any potential family discord over her substantial fortune.</p><p id=e9IFDYKKOUf data-wc=46>As an artist, she has achieved staggering feats: not only does she hold the record for the female artist with the most number-one singles, but she also claims the record for the highest number of tickets sold by a female artist, a whopping total of 11,672,443.</p><p id=eHAsKZtebwa data-wc=43>However, it is not just her musical accomplishments that have contributed to her wealth. Madonna has also ventured into acting and directing, even delving into the worlds of fashion and fitness. Her real estate portfolio is impressive, with properties scattered across the globe.</p><p id=eAbk4EyZN9N data-wc=55>Yet, despite her current affluence, Madonna's beginnings were far from grandiose. Born Madonna Louise Ciccone on August 16, 1958, in Bay City, Michigan, she was raised by Catholic parents Madonna Louise and Silvio Anthony 'Tony' Ciccone. Tragedy struck when her mother died of breast cancer in December 1963, when Madonna was just five years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/041868c7470d-madonna-rare-photo-six-children.jpg><p id=eeOXRPbVSgd data-wc=42>Classical piano lessons and ballet classes marked her early years. Her talent was noticed by her ballet teacher who encouraged her to pursue dance. By the time she graduated from Rochester Adams High School, she was a straight-A student and a cheerleader.</p><p id=eaa_KS_A6dU data-wc=59>In 1978, Madonna dropped out of college and relocated to New York City. She has since spoken about this leap of faith: "It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I'd ever done," she recalled.</p><p id=eAesw2SFxuX data-wc=47>This determination propelled her into the limelight, launching her journey to stardom. From her first self-titled album in 1983 that earned her $1 million, to roles in major films such as "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "Evita", Madonna swiftly became an influential force in both music and movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f7a251b720dd-madonna-boyfriend-joshua-popper.jpg><p id=eNi56Kw6_zC data-wc=42>In 1992, she launched her own multimedia entertainment company, Maverick, in partnership with Time Warner. This resulted in one of the most lucrative contracts ever offered to a pop star, reported to be worth as much as $60 million over seven years.</p><p id=exgPsyjoWAd data-wc=51>Fashion, too, became a significant part of Madonna's portfolio. From a clothing range for H&M that reportedly earned her $4 million, to the Material Girl clothing line inspired by her iconic '80s style, Madonna found success in this realm. She even ventured into skincare with her 2014 Japanese launch, MDNA Skin.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Madonna sneak glimpse of world tour</figure><p id=elZIGwMmlUq data-wc=38>Meanwhile, Madonna’s real estate investments have been profitable, as she owns properties in London, Beverly Hills, New York City, Lisbon, and more. Her extensive art collection, rumored to be worth about $100 million, further adds to her wealth.</p><p id=e8_WJgElHt8 data-wc=46>Despite her recent health scare and the consequent postponement of her Celebrations tour, Madonna remains resilient. In a heartfelt Instagram post, she shared: "My focus now is my health and getting stronger and I assure you I'll be back with you as soon as I can."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWWcW5rZ5mjwKqwxGakmpyfo7uiv4yjmLBllKe8sbzIp55mppWperi70a2fZpmjYsC1rdFmmqimpJq6sbjArZysZaSdsm6y1K2sq51dpLNutMSrZJ6wpJq7tLXVnmSeq6SWwaZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-many-calories-are-in-a-grilled-chicken-patty.html><span>←</span><span>How many calories are in a grilled chicken patty</span></a>
