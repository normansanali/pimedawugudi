David also added that he wants to try everything (implying that he also wants to be with a guy). So is this David lowkey coming out and playing it cool? Then they completely switched topics."</p><p>Other commenters responded in the thread by stating that David has "pretty much confirmed ... he's bi-curious."

I.e. denying rumors and claiming they're straight, saying they're bi-curious, saying they're bi, and then coming out as gay. This is just me jumping to baseless conclusions and it's none of my business anyway, but regardless, he has a supportive group of friends and I'm happy for him either way."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: David Dobrik/YouTube</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you search on YouTube there are plenty of fan compilation videos that have pieced together a bunch of clips that uploaders say is clear evidence David is either bi or gay.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: David Dobrik/YouTube</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Dobrik often features other social media stars in his videos, like former bartender Todd Smith.</h2><p>Todd started gaining some popularity on the internet with Vine first before transitioning to YouTube.
