Anything can inspire me. This morning, I saw this lovely elderly Japanese woman walking down the streets of Hollywood wearing an adorable bonnet with bright red flowers. She might be a song. I remembered an especially painful chapter in my early life last night before going to bed. That might be a song. I woke up this morning and heard a bird chirping in a rhythm that captivated my heart. Maybe that will turn into a new groove. Like everyone else, my feelings are fluid. My ideas are fleeting. I like to keep it that way. I can’t decide in advance what a song or an album concept will be. I have to let those songs and concepts come to me rather than chase them down.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhakh14w001x2c636ji1mg8b@published data-word-count=112>In addition to bird and people watching, Jackson says she’s been spending time stanning for Bruno Mars thanks to her infant son: “I also have a special place in my heart for Bruno Mars. Bruno was really the first music my son responded to. During and after his birth, I comforted myself with Brazilian jazz, music that always relaxes me. Then when the baby began crawling, Bruno was breaking out big and on the radio all the time. That delighted both of us. Bruno is a throwback to the days when the greatest artists could do it all: write, sing, dance, produce.” Well, <a href=#>the Bruno debate has been settled</a> — Janet approves.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Billboard</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Janet Jackson Is Writing New Album About Literally Anything</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocWdganyrrc2eq2aikZi4tLvNZqCsZaentrW1zaBkoZ2iYrumxNNmmKWapaJ6tMDAp6Wippdir7PBzahkppmiqHupwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jake-burton-carpenter.html><span>←</span><span>Jake Burton Carpenter - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Career, Facts</span></a>
