The Polish court jester Stańczyk is arguably the most famous jester in the country’s history — that is, if he ever existed.
Stańczyk’s name is most widely known due to his portrayal in a painting by artist Jan Matejko, which depicts the jester solemnly looking at the ground after hearing the news that Russia had captured Smolensk."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But by the time Matejko created his famous painting in 1862, Stańczyk’s name was already well known among the Poles.</p><p>Scholars have reached a consensus that such a jester did once exist, though the name itself is up for dispute. Contemporary sources mention a fool by the name of Stańczyk and another called Gąska.</p><p>Polish scholar Aleksander Brückner later suggested that both Gąska and Stańczyk may have been two nicknames for the same person, each stemming from the name “Stanisław Gąska,” according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Polish Art Center</a>.</p><p>In any case, legends of Stańczyk often portray him as a witty satirist. One famous story claims that in 1533, King Sigismund the Old asked for a bear to be released in the forest near his palace so he could hunt it. During the hunt, however, the bear charged the king, the queen, and their courtiers — including Stańczyk, who ran away.</p><p>When the king later criticized Stańczyk for fleeing, the jester reportedly responded by saying, “It is a greater folly to let out a bear that was already in a cage.” Many scholars have interpreted this reply as an allusion to the king’s treatment of the newly conquered Prussia.</p><p>Stańczyk ultimately became a symbol of Poland’s struggle for independence, with his likeness being used by a variety of artists and satirists to criticize political hypocrisy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyrsdKtnKurX2k%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-giambi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-465843-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Giambi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
