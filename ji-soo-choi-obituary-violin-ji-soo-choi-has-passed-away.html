Her passing comes as a big loss to all of us. Her brother, Dexter; her mother, Hyun Joo; and her father, Chang Su, in addition to a large number of other family and close friends, will remember her with affection. Ji Soo, who was recognized by the CBC as one of the “30 Hot Canadian Classical Musicians under 30,” began competing at a young age and was successful in a number of competitions.</p><p>He also studied and performed with musicians of the highest caliber in a variety of settings, primarily in South Korea, Toronto, and New York. The person you’re looking at is Ji Soo’s brother, Dexter. It is with deep sorrow that I must inform you that Ji Soo left this world on July 25, 2023, having spent her final day surrounded by loved ones, including her family and friends. This came after a long and difficult battle with lymphoma over the course of the previous 1.5 years.</p><p>Please see the accompanying photo for further information regarding her memorial service, which will take place this coming Saturday, July 29 at 1pm at the Glen Oaks Funeral Home. The viewing will start at 12 in the afternoon. Because my sister intended this to be a celebration of her life filled with happiness and wonderful memories, there will be NO black apparel allowed at this event. She said that she did not want anyone to wear black.</p><p>She advocated for the use of vivid colors, suggesting an atmosphere similar to that of a summer garden party.On July 29, 2023, there will be a memorial event held in her honor to celebrate her life. Donations in memory of the deceased may be donated to the Oakville Hospital Foundation or Lymphoma Canada in place of flowers or other gifts.
