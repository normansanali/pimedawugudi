Well here is a brief overview of the show: a group of contestants referred to as “Houseguests” from all around the world (mostly from the US) come together to live in a specially constructed house away from the outside world for a grand cash prize of $750 thousand.

The one who survives the eviction till the last wins the show.</p><p>Besides Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli, the other 15 contestants of Big Brother 24 are <a href=#>Kyle Capener</a>, Paloma Aguilar, Monte Taylor, Jasmine Davis, Michael Bruner, Taylor Hale, Brittany Hoopes, Daniel Durston, Joseph Abdin, Terrance Higgins, Ameerah Jones, Matt Turner, Nicole Layog, Indy Santos, and Alyssa Snider.</p><p>Joe took to Instagram on July 7, 2022, and asked his fans and followers to tune into CBS and Paramount+ on the series premiere day and support him.
