Get insights into Joose’s age, family, job, and dating life.</p><h3><strong>Joose Jeskanen On TLC’s 7 Little Johnstons</strong></h3><p>On their recent trip to Finland, Trent, Amber, Alex, and Emma visited Joose and his family. Their trip to Finland also included visiting a reindeer farm.</p><p>If you recall properly, Joose Jeskanen was introduced to the viewers of 7 Little Johnstons towards the end of Season 10–and was heavily featured in Season 11.</p><p>“For the next three months, we have an exchange student living with us. We cannot wait to show him life with the Johnstons,” the matriarch Amber Johnston said introducing Joose on Season 11 of the TLC series.</p><p>The main TLC Instagram account also shared a video of Joose riding home with the Johnstons after they picked him up from the airport. “My first reaction when I came here was that, like, cars and trucks are so different. In Finland, cars are a lot smaller. Trucks are rare in Finland,” Joose said in the clip.</p><p>TLC also shared a clip of Joose and the whole Johnstons family wearing inflatable turkey costumes while waiting to wrestle in kiddie pools filled with applesauce and cranberry sauce.</p><p>While we don’t know for how long Joose stayed with the Johnstons, it seemed Amber’s Instagram post on January 8, 2020, marked Joose’s farewell. In the post, she wrote, ” Three months came and gone so quickly. An amazing experience… ‘Familyships’ have been made🇺🇸💛🇫🇮,” sharing tons of pictures and a video clip featuring Joose.</p><p>While most people thought it was Joose’s forever goodbye from the show, he was again featured in Season 12 of the TLC show as the Johnstons met up with Joose at the LPA National Conference in Spokane, Washington, where they also had the opportunity to meet with Joose’s mother for the first time.</p><p>With Joose being featured in Season 13 of the show too, viewers think they’ll see more of the Finland native in the coming episodes and seasons of the 7 Little Johnstons.</p><h3><strong>Is Joose Jeskanen Dating Emma Johnston?</strong></h3><p>Trent and Amber’s fifth child, Emma Johnston, had always been strict with her studies. However, when Joose joined the family in Season 11, she was seen spending more time with the foreign exchange student than she spent on her studies.</p><p>All this raised one big question: Are Joose Jeskanen and Emma Johnston dating each other?</p><p>The rumor that Joose and Emma are dating each other spiraled up when some of the fans of the show noticed Emma blushing when she was near the foreign exchange student; the fans also noticed Emma cutely looking at Joose sometimes. Apart from this, the Tik-Toks dance videos the duo made together–and the amazing chemistry the two featured–also added to the dating rumors.</p><p>However, in an Instagram post dating back to October 11, 2022, which was a recap of Emma’s life then involving her visit to Finland, Emma cleared all the dating rumors by replying to a comment asking “Is it a rumor or are you guys dating?”. She said, “All those rumors you see/hear are FALSE!! family/friends will always be my number 1 thing… joose & I are really good friends and we’re also like family. getting to know Joose & his family was an amazing experience bc we became close family with one another.”</p><p>Emma also shared that she will never share information about her dating life to the public.</p><p>That means Joose dating Emma Lee Johnston was nothing more than a rumor.</p><h3><strong>Joose Jeskanen Age</strong></h3><p>Joose Jeskanen turned 19 years old in May 2023.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Joose Jeskanen From?</strong></h3><p>Reality star Joose Jeskanen hails from Joensuu, Finland. On December 6, 2022, Joose recalled him and the cast of the 7 Little Johnstons celebrating the 104th Finnish Independence Day one year ago. He said, “Last year Johnstons made the day an immemorial one for me.”</p><h3><strong>Joose Jeskanen Family</strong></h3><p>Talking about Joose Jeskanen’s family, his mother is Elina Sarpola. As per her LinkedIn handle, she works as a data scientist at Productivity Leap. She has a Master’s Degree in Economics and Statistics from the University of Helsinki.</p><p>Elina initially did not want Joose to participate in any kind of foreign student exchange program because she was concerned about his well-being. However, when Joose wished to experience a foreign student exchange program because his siblings were a part of such programs, Elina searched for families that would be suitable for her son. That was how she came across the Johnstons.</p><p>When the Johnstons visited Joose and his family, Elina expressed how grateful she was to the Johnstons for taking good care of her son while he was in the States.</p><p>Pekka Jeskanen is Joose’s father. He works as a senior advisor for Business Finland.</p><p>Coming to Joose’s siblings, he has 3 (two sisters and 1 brother), all younger than him. Their names are Jasmi, Juuli, and Jeetu.</p><h3><strong>Joose Jeskanen Job</strong></h3><p>Till 2022, Joose Jeskanen was a high school student and did not do any jobs. However, in an Instagram post on May 8, 2023, he shared that he has started summer work at the local ”Target” and called it an awesome job.</p><p>While we don’t know his salary, the entry-level hourly pay at Target is around $21. We guess Joose’s hourly salary is around that figure.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Joose Jeskanen Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Joose Jeskanen celebrates his birthday on the 16th of May every year.
