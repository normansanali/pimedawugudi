Read on to learn 25 things about the 35-year-old and his partnership with Flonase.</p><p>1. I’ve never had a real job, but I worked at a baseball camp for kids.</p><p>2. My favorite snacks are Kit Kats and Oreos with milk. I have such a sweet tooth.</p><p>3. My wife <a href=#><strong>Kate</strong> [<strong>Upton</strong>]</a> and I like to go out for dinner and a movie for our date nights.</p><p>4. I do everything in threes before a game since there are three outs. Like, if I use the bathroom at the field, I take three paper towels.</p><p>5. The hardest part about being a baseball player is traveling and being away from my wife and dog Harley.</p><p>6. I didn’t drink at all in high school, but I had a good time in college.</p><p>7. For my hair, I use a light pomade and then hit it with some hair spray.</p><p>8. The best thing I make are my bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches. It’s my go-to meal.</p><p>9. The best <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> I’ve received was a Rolex engraved after I won Rookie of the Year [in 2006]. Winning the World Series ring [last year] was pretty great too.</p><p>10. I’m a pretty good dancer. I’ve fallen out of touch with the new dances the kids do, but I can still hold my own in the middle of a dance floor.</p><p>11. I wear number 35 because of [now-retired player] <strong>Frank Thomas</strong>. My first year, I struck him out on a 103-mph pitch, my fastest ever. Very full circle moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/justin-verlander-kate-upton-25-things.jpg><p>12. My favorite childhood show was Saved by the Bell. I had such a crush on Jessie.</p><p>13. My favorite celeb encounter was with Kate! We first met at a commercial shoot, and I had my microphone on and didn’t realize. I told my friends that I was gonna get her number and she heard me! But it worked.</p><p>14. The cutest thing Harley, our boxer, does is snuggling up to us. He loves to cuddle.</p><p>15. I binge-watch ­everything. The last show I watched was The 100. It’s so good.</p><p>16. Growing up, I used to collect baseball cards. Not one sticks out, though.</p><p>17. My weirdest fan encounter was when Kate and I went to Slovenia and someone recognized me instead of her!</p><p>18. My fantasy is to beat all of the other teams!</p><p>19. If I wasn’t playing baseball, I would be doing sports commentary for TV.</p><p>20. My first car was a purple Ford Taurus that was nicknamed “The Purple Mongoose.”</p><p>21. I’m kinda OCD. I need everything to be perfect. Organization is key.</p><p>22. I love sports cars. My dream is a Ferrari. They’re the best. 23. People don’t know that I am a Flonase user, but I have been using it for years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. In high school, my nickname was Skippy because I skipped the JV baseball team.</p><p>25. Kate tries to put face masks on me because she wants me to look good when I’m old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq951Z6ppZmembKzeZFuZK2gmaO0tHnYqKxmnJ%2BjwW63zaiuZpmSpMK1ecyeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-streamer-pokimane-amassed-2-million-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Here's How Streamer Pokimane Amassed Her $2 Million Net Worth</span></a>
