I’m in trouble, but hopefully, hopefully my husband will not be too mad. … We don’t want to be that pretentious over the name, but it’s the only kind of thing you can hold on to that feels private.”</p><p>The “original” moniker came to the couple “two hours before [their son] was born.” McPhee explained the inspiration behind it, telling Cagle, 55: “It’s a really great family name, but one of [Foster’s] family members didn’t tell us about it until hours before he was born. It sort of took my breath away. I was waiting for something like that, and I just didn’t think it would happen. We were going to name him something totally different, which was a great name, but not something that meant something.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>News broke in October 2020 that the Smash alum was <a href=#>expecting her first child</a>, one year after she and the Grammy winner<a href=#> tied the knot in London</a>.
