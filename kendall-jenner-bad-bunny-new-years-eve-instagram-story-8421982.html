Many believe the relationship fizzled out long before that since the two hadn't been seen together since October of 2023. Neither Jenner nor Bunny have officially said anything about the breakup.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jim Poorten/NBAE via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jenner's continued friendship (or more) with Bunny is in line with comments she made last year. In an interview, she explained that she loves "really hard" and hates saying goodbye.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I will fight to not have to say good-bye," the model told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Harper's Bazaar</a>. "I love really hard and I love without apology."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For his part, Bunny is unlikely to say anything about the relationship. In an interview, he said that he doesn't feel the need to explain his personal life to fans or anyone else —&nbsp;going as far as saying that he'd prefer if they didn't know anything about him at all.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They don't know how you feel, they don't know how you live, they don't know anything, and I really don't want them to know," he told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a>.
