We learned of four players who have tested positive for the illness. All members of the Brooklyn Nets, including former MVP Kevin Durant, tested positive on Tuesday. Further, he didn’t play this season due to a torn Achilles tendon and was already not planning to return even if things get pushed back late into the summer.</p><p>NBA spokesperson Mike Bass declared a statement on the number of active players who have received tests for the COVID-19 virus on Tuesday night.</p><p>“Public health authorities and team doctors have been concerned that, given NBA players’ direct contact with each other and close interactions with the general public, in addition to their frequent travel, they could accelerate the spread of the virus. Following two players testing positive last week, others were tested and five additional players tested positive. Hopefully, by these players choosing to make their rest results public, they have drawn attention to the critical need for young people to follow CDC recommendations in order to protect others, particularly those with underlying health conditions and the elderly.”</p><p>“All players and members of the Nets travel party are being asked to remain isolated, closely monitor their health, and maintain constant communication with team medical staff,” the team said. He also added that they are notifying anyone who has had contact with the players, including N.B.A. opponents.</p><h4><span>More information about Corona Virus</span></h4><p>Three of the four players did not show symptoms of the disease according to the Nets statement. A spokesperson for the Nets declined to provide specifics about how the team got the tests. This issue of unequal access to testing arose last week. It was after reports that 58 members of the Jazz franchise got tested within hours of Gobert’s positive test.</p><p>In the United States, almost all professional sports leagues are at a standstill as many local and state governments restrict large gatherings. Among all the games, the N.B.A. has the largest number of publicly revealed cases of coronavirus cases, and hence its season is in danger of being canceled.</p><p>Gobert, the first player known to have tested positive, has faced backlash for making light of the epidemic in the days leading up to finding out he had COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. People also criticized the N.B.A. for organizing multiple games while the coronavirus was spreading across the United States. Gobert apologized for the day after the N.B.A. season was postponed, stating “I was careless and make no excuse.”</p><h4><span>Brooklyn Nets</span></h4><p>Although he was expected to miss the 2019-20 NBA season due to his Achilles injury, it was announced at the beginning of the 2019 free agency period that the star first had agreed to a four-year deal with the Brooklyn Nets.</p><p>In March 2020, shortly after the NBA suspended its season due to the coronavirus outbreak, Durant revealed that he had tested positive for the virus.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Kevin Durant was born to Wanda and Wayne Pratt on <strong>September 29, 1988</strong>, in Washington D.C., USA.
