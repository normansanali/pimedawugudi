The 39-year-old multihyphenate is the first of six high-profile figures highlighted by the magazine <a href=#>for helping “shape” the last decade</a>.</p><p>“So I’d say 2010, 2011 was like, ‘I’ll do anything.’ Cupcakes, milkshakes,” she said of early days. “So I go to a milkshake place in Dubai, thinking, ‘Oh, it’s just, you know, some little milkshake store.’ Maybe, like, 250,000 people showed up to the Dubai mall. I had never seen anything like it before. We had to sneak out the back.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty mogul continued, “I mean, I took videos of the thousands, hundreds of thousands of people at the mall in Dubai. My mom [<a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>] and I looked at each other — because I made her come with me — and we were like, ‘Holy s–t. What is going on? A milkshake place?’”</p><p>According to Kardashian, there is “really nothing” the general public doesn’t already know about her. Beginning in October 2007, she let the world in on her behind-the-scenes life with her family’s E! reality series, <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>. The success of this long-running show <a href=#>has inspired several spinoffs</a>, including Kourtney & Khloé Take Miami, starring her sisters <a href=#><strong>Kourtney</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>, and Life of Kylie, which featured the youngest KarJenner member, <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>.</p><p>Over a decade later, Keeping Up With the Kardashians is still going strong as it’s currently airing episodes from its 17th season. In regards to <a href=#>documenting her life on television</a>, Kim has no regrets.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve never regretted it. I’ve always felt, like, I’m so grateful to have all of those memories on-camera,” she explained. “I will look back and think, ‘Oh, my God, what was I wearing? Why is my makeup like that?’”</p><p>The Selfish author even admitted that she can “sit back and laugh” about how much she “cared” about making a name for herself early on, adding: “Oh my God, I was desperate!”</p><p>Scroll down to read more revelations from <a href=#>Kim’s The Cut interview</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc2sZKedp2LGsL7KZqSan5Gvtq%2BxjKKlrZ2iq7amw4xvZKudppq5osDIqKWsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-rogans-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Rogans Net Worth And Biography</span></a>
