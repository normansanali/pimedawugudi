According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Insider</a>, the man violated the Weapons Control Act by possessing military-grade weapons. His lawyers, however, argued that because most of his collection was non-functioning, he could not be charged.</p><p>The man, identified in court documents as Klaus-Dieter F. from Heikendorf, had also amassed a torpedo, 70 rifles and machine guns, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and an unspecified number of semi and fully automatic pistols.</p><p>German authorities were initially alerted to the hoard in 2005 when a home inspection revealed much of the collection.
