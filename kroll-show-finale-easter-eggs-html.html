They’re also the twins who were in “Gigolo House,” and can be seen playing sperm inside Bobby Bottleservice in “<a href=#>Body Bouncers</a>.” Says Kroll: “In season three, we found out that they’re musicians and singers. They have a YouTube video of them singing [Ke$ha and Pitbull’s] ‘Timber’ acoustic, and we did ‘Broin’ Country,’ which is sort of like ‘Timber,’ so we thought it would be amazing then to take our song and change it for Wendy Shawn to have for his bar mitzvah because those guys just felt so like the people you’d be seeing at a bar mitzvah.”</li><li>Washed-up hair-metal star Nash Rickey’s underrated hit “<a href=#>L.A.
