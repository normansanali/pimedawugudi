The 37-year-old’s home life continues to eclipse her floundering campaign for Colorado’s fourth district as her son becomes the latest member of the family to face an arrest.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>Boebert’s 18-year-old son, Tyler Boebert, already made headlines last year when he made his mother — a teenage parent herself — a grandmother at 36. He was front-page news once again in late February after he was arrested in relation to a string of crimes in his mother’s current district. The 18-year-old now faces 22 charges including several potential felonies, all related to a “recent string of vehicle trespass and property thefts,” according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider</a>.</p><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>A perusal of Boebert’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Garfield County Jail record</a> shows that the eldest Boebert child faces four counts of “criminal possession of a financial device,” another four counts of “criminal possession [of] ID documents,” three counts of “first degree criminal trespass auto with intent to commit a crime,” and one count of “conspiracy to commit a felony,” among others. That’s on top of three counts of “theft” totaling less than $300 each.</p><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Boebert’s arrest adds yet another level of chaos to his mother’s ongoing scheme to maintain a position in Congress. That position in Congress —&nbsp;which she’s held since 2021 — earns her a solid $174,000 annually, on top of the representative’s previous wealth and her ex-husband’s business earnings. While its undoubtably true that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">debunked rumors of Boebert’s net worth</a> — which some falsely estimated between $12 million and $41 million — were inflated, she’s still not slumming it like the rest of us.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Boebert Crime Family is approaching 100 total combined arrests, criminal charges and police contacts. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oWcQlbCtr2</a></p>— Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) <a href=#>February 28, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=842 data-injectable=true>Which makes the optics of her son robbing regular citizens, all in the district Boebert is payed to keep safe, all the more damning ⏤ and that’s on top of all the other embarrassing antics <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dragging the Boebert family name through the mud</a>. This includes the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">representative’s own misbehavior,</a> which saw the 37-year-old become a widespread laughing stock after she (one of many Republicans screeching about “morals” and “family values”) was filmed vaping and fondling at a public performance of Beetlejuice.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>It all adds up to a very bad look for Boebert, particularly in a year in which the utter embarrassment of a representative is seeking re-election, and this time in a more right-leaning district. Even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Colorado’s fourth district is set to reject Boebert,</a> however, and we imagine her family’s latest antics aren’t helping the campaign much at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S5osHRnqVmmp%2Bar6a%2B06xkanBdrrKivoyoo51lo6S7bq3Rq5ysrJWZeqe70WaZq52RoLavs4yipa2nXZius7%2BMmqWdZaOpsqK4yKeeZqyYnruov44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ji-soo-choi-obituary-violin-ji-soo-choi-has-passed-away.html><span>←</span><span>Ji Soo Choi Obituary Violin, Ji Soo Choi Has Passed Away</span></a>
