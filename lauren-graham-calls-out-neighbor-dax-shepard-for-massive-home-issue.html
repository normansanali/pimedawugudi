He bought that,” she said.</p><p>Though the <a href=#>Mighty Ducks: Game Changers</a> star doesn’t live right across the fence from the 46-year-old “Armchair Expert” host, they do live in the same neighborhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lauren-Graham-Calls-Out-Dax-Shepard-For-Home-Issue-Promo.jpg><p>“The way we’re situated, I pass him all the time. It’s a beautiful house,” the Talking as Fast as I Can author said of her former coworker, who lives with his wife, <a href=#><strong>Kristen Bell</strong></a>, and their daughters Lincoln, 8, and Delta, 6.</p><p>Because she resides in such close proximity to the family, Graham has also noted some strangeness in their landscaping strategy.</p><p>“He basically took what others might consider to be the front lawn and turned it into a massive driveway for all his cars,” the Gilmore Girls alum said.</p><p>“Paved paradise and put up a parking lot?” <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> </a>joked.</p><p>“Literally,” Graham replied.</p><p>The comedian, 53, noted that he’d been curious about the bus after Shepard told him about it during an earlier appearance on the talk show.</p><p>“I was wondering if it was causing any kind of concern in the neighborhood, and apparently it is,” Kimmel said.</p><p>Graham joked that she “gave up” on her TV sibling a long time ago, adding “He rides around topless on a motorcycle. You have to just love him. He’s my brother.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Hawaii native has spoken about her love for the Zathura actor before. In February 2020, <a href=#>Graham said she and Shepard will be “friends until we die”</a> and opened up about how great it is that the pals live close by.</p><p>“It’s just so fun. Our neighborhood is fun,” she said during an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show at the time. “He has two girls and they have a real tough-guy looking Jeep kind of thing — a jeep for kids that they drive around the neighborhood.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmaWnsq95xquYoZmdYrCiuMusZKitpGK7prXGoZmoql2Zrrl50qGcqZmimXqnu9FmpJqro57DpnnHqKSeZZmowLaxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eli-manning-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-html.html><span>←</span><span>Eli Manning Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship, Family</span></a>
