Order franchise but Wolf tried again with Law & Order True Crime.</p><p>Typically, each episode of Law & Order tells a different story, but True Crime only focused on dramatizing the murders of <a

producer Richard "Dick" Anthony Wolf.</p><p>He created the original show in the 1990s and has since made it into a <a href=#>television</a> empire, making him one of the most famous faces in the <a href=#>entertainment industry</a>,</p><p>“Wherever I go in the country, wherever I go in the world, people reference Dick Wolf shows,” TV producer Greg Berlanti said of Wolf's career during an interview with <a href=# aria-label="Variety (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“Sometimes folks in New York and L.A. get so focused on shows that get a ton of Emmy nominations. But the priority is telling stories that move an audience. The real value of any show is ultimately its relationship with an audience. Dick Wolf makes shows that people love and love to talk about.”</p><p>Shortly before the launch of Law & Order, he created the production company Wolf Entertainment, which is also responsible for the <a href=#>Chicago</a> and <a href=#>FBI franchises</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvY2mGeIKYaKOar12Wu6V5zqubnqpdqL2quoyonZ%2BrXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gaston-rojas-southern-hospitality.html><span>←</span><span>Gaston Rojas Has a Connection to Southern Hospitality</span></a>
