The pair met while filming 2010’s The Last Song and got engaged two years later.</p><p>The twosome experienced <a href=#>many ups and downs over the years</a>, including a 2013 split before tying the knot in December 2018. The <a href=#>duo’s nuptials</a> came just one month after they lost their Malibu home to a wildfire.</p><p>Despite dating on and off for nearly a decade, their relationship fizzled out by August 2019 and <a href=#>Hemsworth filed for divorce</a>. The Hannah Montana alum later opened up about their decision to get married after such a devastating life event, hinting that she was grasping for stability in the wake of the fire.</p><p>“We were together since [I was] 16. Our house burned down. We had been, like, engaged — I don’t know if we really ever thought we were actually going to get married — but when we lost our house in Malibu, which if you listen to my voice pre and post-fire, they’re very different, so that trauma really affected my voice,” <a href=#>the “Bad Karma” singer told <strong>Howard Stern</strong> in December 2020</a>. “Me being an intense person and not wanting to sit with it and not wanting to go, you know, ‘What could be purposeful about this?’ I just clung to what I had left of that house, which was me and him.”</p><p>The “Climb” songstress further explained to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> that same month that Hemsworth made her feel safe after experiencing so much loss. “As you drown, you reach for that lifesaver and you want to save yourself,” Cyrus told the outlet in her January 2021 cover story. “I think that’s really what, ultimately, getting married was for me. One last attempt to save myself.”</p><p>Hemsworth, for his part, told <a href=#>Men’s Health</a> in April 2020 that he had learned to block out all the noise surrounding his personal life following his divorce. (At the time, he was dating model <a href=#><strong>Gabriella Brooks</strong></a>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“For a long period of time, it was very stressful, and it really got to me. … These days I don’t want to invest any more time in worrying about that sort of stuff,” the Most Dangerous Game alum said. “I remind myself of what to appreciate now and to enjoy every moment as much as possible, whether that be working or with my family or whatever I’m doing. Just trying to find a positive in it all and enjoy life as much as possible.”</p><p>Scroll down for a complete recap of Hemsworth’s dating history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuaqtzGafnqWjrLyzwMesZJ2ZpJ67qHnHoqqtp6KuerW1zJ6joqaVYrynecWapKito2KyubHSZp2loZ6cwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-couric-reveals-secret-to-her-and-husband-john-molners-marriage.html><span>←</span><span>Katie Couric Reveals Secret to Her and Husband John Molner's Marriage</span></a>
