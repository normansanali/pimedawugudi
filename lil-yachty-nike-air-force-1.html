Meanwhile, a "concrete boy" character gets to work on the heel, rendered entirely in the navy shade. Otherwise, that pretty much wraps up Yachty's Forces.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Yachty, a well-documented sneakerhead, frequently keeps Nike's classics in rotation (even the more forgotten ones). So, it's not all that shocking to see him dish out subtle Crete Boy touches but also preserve much of the icon's traditional look, down to the mistakable "Air" on the midsole.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Do I wish that Yachty did more with his Nikes? Sure. I'm hoping more will come from the partnership down the road, but the Forces are a simple albeit solid start, nonetheless.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">For Boat, simplicity plus a classic scheme wins the race, from the looks of it — fans are speeding to cop these Forces.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">So, when are Lil Yachty's Concrete Boys x Nike Air Force 1 sneakers releasing? Well, it's unknown if the pairs will land at Nike soon (fans are hoping so).</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">But Wish ATL is hosting a "Fresh AF1 Tour," with the first stop in Atlanta, of course. Yachty will be at the Atlanta store on November 17, offering exclusive Nike x Concrete Boys merch, maybe even including the Concrete Boys Forces.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">For those unfamiliar, Concrete Boys is Yachty's record label, featuring artists Draft Day, Camo!, Dc2Trill, and KARRAHBOOO. The collective, including Yachty, recently dropped their On the Radar freestyles, which instantly went viral and placed even more eyes on the bubbling artists.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Like the group's raps, the Concrete Boys Forces are equally solid.
