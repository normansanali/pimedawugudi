She feels lost in her emotions and unable to control her feelings. The song is addressed to this man, with her asking him about his true feelings for her. She is telling him things that she feels she shouldn't be sharing, and she wonders if she is a fool for being so open with him. She wants to believe the rumors that he has a crush on her, but she is also afraid of being hurt.</p><br><p>The lyrics are very raw and emotional, with the singer expressing her vulnerability and insecurity. She is putting herself out there, risking rejection and heartbreak, but she can't help herself. The chorus repeats the phrase "lost in emotion," which captures the feeling of being overwhelmed by strong feelings of love and attraction.</p><br><p>Overall, the song speaks to the universal experience of falling in love and feeling unsure of whether or not the other person feels the same way. It's a poignant and heartfelt ballad that showcases Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam's talent for soulful, emotional music.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Hit the beat now</u><br>Let's start the music</p><br><p><u>Lost in emotion</u><br>Feeling overwhelmed by emotions and love</p><br><p><u>Some guys will promise you a Marriage made in heaven</u><br>Men may make empty promises to women</p><br><p><u>But I'm gonna stick to my guns Like waitin for their love that I might be gettin</u><br>She will maintain her standards and not settle for less</p><br><p><u>My dreams have just begun</u><br>She has a lot of aspirations and is still at the beginning stages of fulfilling them</p><br><p><u>Am I awful to think of love</u><br>Is it wrong to think about love?</p><br><p><u>Are you free</u><br>Do you have time for us?</p><br><p><u>And love for you, oh my And come to see you oh oh</u><br>Expressing deep love and desire to see the person</p><br><p><u>Telling you things you really shouldn't know</u><br>Revealing personal information to the person she is in love with</p><br><p><u>Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion</u><br>She is overwhelmed with emotions and love</p><br><p><u>Am I fool at least my friends think so</u><br>Her friends think she is foolish to be so in love</p><br><p><u>Que sera Sera Baby, whenever we're free, que sera sera</u><br>What will be, will be.
