She accessorized with body pearls by the designer and visor shades that matched her swimwear. In the first selfie, the singer stood beneath a shower head, rinsing off after the beach. The other images captured the hitmaker striking different poses on the beach. The Instagram carousel also celebrated the success of her banger (and arguably song of the summer), "It's About Damn Time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"#1 SONG IN THE COUNTRY AND I AINT EVEN IN THE COUNTRY ASS BITCH ü•µ," she wrote alongside the gallery in honor of her song going number one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The same day she shared a video to her grid in the chaotic beach look. After squealing and laughing she said to the camera, "I remember when I was telling my friend's mom what my major in college was gonna be, and I told her I was going to major in music performance. And she laughed in my face. She said, 'Music performance? Like Beyonc√©?' And she laughed in my face. Only have one thing to say: 'BYE.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer then held up her phone which was playing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Beyonc√©</a> and Madonna's "Break My Soul (Queen's Remix)." The tune lists off a slew of iconic Black women in the same spoken-word fashion as Madonna's song "Vogue."
