Episodes of Love Island usually air two days after they are filmed and Saturday does not air a new episode ‚Äì other than Unseen Bits of the past week‚Äôs events.</p><p>Casa Amor‚Äôs recoupling was filmed on July 4 and aired on July 5.

She has had two conversations with Scott, both of which have turned into arguments, before saying she‚Äôs ‚Äúleaving it there.‚Äù</p><p>She then kissed Elom in the main villa, after kissing him twice outside of challenges in Casa Amor. Although Scott knows the truth after asking if she smooched Elom, it may hit more heartstrings to actually watch it happen.</p><p>Catherine also cuddled Scott in bed but told Elom she had never done that, which had fans baffled. A fan wrote: ‚ÄúMaybe Catherine will apologize to Scott after movie night or even before.
