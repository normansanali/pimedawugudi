Aster’s films deal with the complexities of human behavior, grief, and trauma, all manifesting as terror.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>The same thing can be applied to Talk to Me, which deals with acute trauma and ways to cope with it. Unlike various other familiar horror movies where demonic possession constitutes the film’s climactic and most terrifying moment, in Talk to Me, the protagonist Mia (Sophie Wilde) finds in possession an outlet for her inherent trauma which ultimately leads to disastrous consequences.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=false>That said, both the Philippou brothers and Aster – along with many others – are actively contributing to making horror a powerful, nuanced genre. While the journey is new for the former, we look forward to seeing how they fare against the latter both critically, commercially, and physically if the fight happens.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJ5lkaOxbq3RomSaq6Sav26t0Z5kna2VYq5us86om2ark6eusXnTmqOkZaSkeq6xjJ2gq52TqbyzedGemJ2xXam8bsDHq6awZZSkxK951qKroWWRo7y1tMSrZKGnoqe8s3nMmpysrKKkfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeff-hardy-reveals-meaning-behind-giant-new-tattoo.html><span>←</span><span>Jeff Hardy Reveals Meaning Behind Giant New Tattoo</span></a>
