And the punishment for some scolds was a medieval torture device called a <a href=# rel=noopener>Scold’s Bridle</a>.</p><p>The device was basically an iron mask which was fitted over a woman’s face. A lock at the back held the mask into place, and a metal gag held the tongue down. Sometimes, the gags were spiked, which would cut the tongue if the woman tried to speak.</p><p>This device had a dual purpose. It would silence the woman accused of being a scold and it would humiliate her. Often, she would be forced to walk through town or stand in the main square so others could see her shame.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-493412 alt="Scolds Bridles" width=800 height=981 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/scolds-bridles.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-493412 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>The Print Collector/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Different kinds of Scold’s Bridles, which were used on women accused of “gossiping, nagging or scandal-mongering.”</span></p><p>The first mention of this medieval torture device came in the 14th century, when one of Geoffrey Chaucer’s characters remarked: “would she were bolted with a Bridle.” Later anecdotes describe how women accused of being “scolds” or having “loose morals” were punished with a Scold’s Bridle.</p><p>Indeed, it seems that this device was used for hundreds of years. It wasn’t until the dawn of the Victorian era that Scold’s Bridles were declared “barbaric” — though the last known use of a Scold’s Bridle was in 1856.</p><p>This torture device was painful and humiliating, and it sought to show women everywhere how dangerous speaking their minds could be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuscOinK%2BZnGLBsL7TrqmeZZSaw6qvxKxmcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-khloe-kardashian-hand-controversy-gets-even-messier.html><span>←</span><span>The Khlo Kardashian Hand Controversy Gets Even Messier</span></a>
