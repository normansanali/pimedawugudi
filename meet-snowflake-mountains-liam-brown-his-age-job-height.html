But Liam Brown had enough of the “nagging” and decided to live with his nan so he could go out partying with what little he earned. This made Liam a perfect candidate to endure the challenges on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Snowflake Mountain</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Get to know him better as this article proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Liam Brown On Snowflake Mountain</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Liam Brown traded his life of comfort and luxury to appear on the new Netflix reality show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Snowflake Mountain</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022. Being one of the 10 participants, the guy was clubbed with a group of affluent yet spoilt young adults (a.k.a Snowflakes) and put in the middle of nowhere — with no running water, WiFi, or home luxuries at hand.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Well, it was obvious that Liam would feel entirely out of his element. But he was determined not to give in. The initial challenges were quite tough for Liam but managed to push through his fear and over time, acknowledge what a life-changing opportunity it was.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, acknowledging his weakness wasn’t just enough to win the competition. He lost the finals to Deandra and Sunny. For those who missed the eps, after conquering the mountain climbing challenge and reaching the peak, Liam was named one of three finalists eligible for the cash prize.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even though Liam might not have won that stunning $50 thousand, he definitely won a lot of hearts including that of the hosts, Joe (an army combat engineer) and Matt (a former navy explosive ordnance disposal). They appreciated Liam’s positive attitude and enthusiastic nature.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Go on reality TV, you’d be good they said? Okay, he said🤪 Wow, keeping this a secret for a year was challenging to say the least lmaoooo👏 I’m coming to a @netflix screen near you, keep your eyes peeled,” Liam shared his excitement on IG days before the show’s premiere.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Liam at the wellness retreat this season were his co-stars — Solomon (unemployed), Randy (a “boujee brawler”), Deandra (a make-up artist based), Olivia (a Harry Styles fan), Devon (a born rebel), Rae Hume (a happy-go girl), Darriea (a free-spirited soul), Carl Lariviere (a model and actor), and Sunny (a “hot dog restaurant”).</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>L</span><b>iam Brown Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Liam Brown was 22 when he appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Snowflake Mountain</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He is the same age as his co-contestant Carl Lariviere.</span></p><h3><b>Is Liam Brown Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Liam Brown is allegedly dating Prudence Ratcliffe. Or at least, this was what “TheCinemahoilc.com” mentioned.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, if you ask us. There’s no evidence that the two are dating.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, the only time the duo appeared together in a photo (at the time of writing this article) was on Prudence’s IG post dated Jan 3, 2022, captioned, “Start off with the amazing brother❤️ but Just a few of my favorite people.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Liam’s alleged girlfriend, Prudence is a model who has walked in a few campaigns including London Fashion Week.

And because of this, he developed into a lazy and not-so-outdoorsy person. Naturally, his parents then tried to encourage him into being more active. But it backlashed, leading Liam to leave the family home and go live with his nan.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even after his stint in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Snowflake Mountain</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Liam had no thought of returning home. Instead, he was looking forward to bettering himself in every way possible, still away from his parents.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The only members we know of Liam’s family are Shane Brown (cousin) and Angela Brown.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, we were informed that Liam’s grandfather passed away in July 2020.</span></p><h3><b>Liam Brown Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Liam Brown worked as the marketing executive of the fashion retail company, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>In The Style</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.
