It's not for everyone, but clearly, those with a large following stand to make bank from the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan Barton-Hanson became a household name thanks to Love Island, and once she turned to OnlyFans, she started to rake in a 7-figure income.</p><p>Let's see how the former reality star went from small screen sensation to OnlyFans star in just a few years.</p><h2 id=megan-barton-hanson-blew-up-on-39-love-island-39>Megan Barton-Hanson Blew Up On 'Love Island'</h2><p>During season 4 of Love Island, Megan Barton-Hanson came on the show and made an impression on fans in no time. She made her entrance a few days after things kicked off, but she managed to last for some time, and in that time, she was able to become an infamous part of the show's history.</p><p>Even though the show gave her a platform and helped her become a household name, things weren't always easy. The star admits that social media <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took its toll</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's not healthy to be on social media all the time and you'll end up reading nasty comments from weeks back, when you were still on the show, and that can be quite traumatic."</p><p>After appearing on the show, Barton-Hanson would make headlines for numerous things, including some appearances on other shows.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Blames Bella Thorne For OnlyFans Removing Explicit Content</a></span></p><h2 id=megan-barton-hanson-made-other-tv-appearances>Megan Barton-Hanson Made Other TV Appearances</h2><p>One of the good things about generating some press on a reality show is that the door to make appearances elsewhere can be opened. This is what happened for Megan, who would go on to appear on several other shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to IMDb, she would appear on shows like Loose Women, Celebs Go Dating, Celeb Ex in the City, and CelebAbility.</p><p>She would also become a contributor to Vice, dominate on social media, and continuously find ways to keep her name circulating in the headlines.</p><p>With a louder voice than before, she has been able to speak on things that others have shied away from.</p><p>"There was never anyone in the media when I was growing up who would speak openly about female pleasure and periods so I'm so thankful that I've got that platform. It's snowballed for me," she said.</p><p>Due to the continued fame and large following that she has maintained since appearing on Love Island, she has been able to find some lucrative ventures. Specifically, her time on OnlyFans has generated big business, and some might be blown away by how much she is rumored to make on a monthly basis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tyga Plans To Create His Own Platform After OnlyFans Announced Its Ban For Adult Content</a></span></p><h2 id=megan-barton-hanson-is-now-making-millions-on-onlyfans-thanks-to-her-fame>Megan Barton-Hanson Is Now Making Millions On OnlyFans Thanks To Her Fame</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meaww</a>, "Barton-Hanson turned to OnlyFans in March last year, just when the UK went into lockdown. She now makes thousands sharing explicit videos and selfies on the website. It has been reported that Megan now earns over £800,000-a-month ($1,109,199) from the members-only website. Reports say that it is with this income that she has been able to purchase her first home in Essex last month. Apparently, she also has plans to buy more properties to rent."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most people can't even dream of bringing in this type of money over the course of a decade, let alone during the span of 30 days. Clearly, she knows a thing or two about making money, but in truth, her salary from the site pales in comparison to other celebs who have taken to the platform.</p><p>To put things into perspective, Meaww, via Influencer Marketing Hub, shows that</p><p>Blac Chyna was making "$19.99 million a month from her OnlyFans content. With a total of 143 posts and 13.2K likes on her account, the reality TV star-turned-model happens to be a top earner on the site even though her subscription rates were higher than usual in the beginning."</p><p>Regardless of Barton-Hanson falling well short of $20 million each month, the fact that she is raking in 7 figures on the regular for her work online is truly remarkable, and it shows just how much the site can pay when a celebrity gets involved. Some might not agree with what she does, but it more than pays the bills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Travis Barker's Parenting Is In Question After Shanna Moakler Launches OnlyFans</a></span></p><p>Reality TV does not work out for everyone, but for Megan Barton-Hanson, it put her on a collision course with a mountain of cash.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Bhad Bhabie And Tana Mongeau's Video Of Wishes Poised To Generate Massive OnlyFans Income</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknp%2BRo3qjrdGtpqdlmJa7tLvNZqOorpVitrS4wKebZqeeocanrc2sZKahnKG2sLrAoqmeZaOWuaK%2B2Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fitness-weight-loss-myths.html><span>←</span><span>Fitness &amp;amp; Weight Loss Myths: Trainers' Advice</span></a>
