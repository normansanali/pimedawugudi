His earnings are said to be over $300 million, and he is known as a connoisseur of sorts, as he is an artist, art collector, restaurateur, and more.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-10289 alt="Animal Tendencies" width=700 height=525 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bizzare-Art-Hirst-Physical-Impossibility.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-10289 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Source: TVn24</a></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-10291 alt="Bizarre Art Damien Hirst" width=700 height=525 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bizzare-Art-Hirst-Physical-Impossibility-Shark.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-10291 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Source: Terrafiniti</a></p><p>Though Hirst creates a variety of works, including spot paintings and spin paintings, one of his most intriguing exhibits was the “Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living” in which he preserved a tiger shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine. The work was created in 1991, and the shark specimen was replaced in 2006 due to deterioration of the original.</p><p>Hirst created similar exhibits using other preserved animals such as a cow, zebra, and a calf with gold horns and hooves that he titled “The Golden Calf”. Hirst also used thousands of butterflies in his project titled “In and Out of Love”. Sadly, the artist passed away in 2012.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-10292 alt="Bizarre Art Animal Tendencies" width=700 height=598 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bizzare-Art-Hirst-Butterflies.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-10292 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Source: Velour</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuu9KtZJuhqpa%2Fs7GMmqmtZ2I%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quavo.html><span>←</span><span>Quavo Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
