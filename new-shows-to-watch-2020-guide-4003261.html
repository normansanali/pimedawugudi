They are continually drawn back to each other, like magnets. <strong>Daisy Edgar-Jones</strong> and<strong> Paul Mescal</strong> are stellar as Marianne and Connell. Their chemistry is palpable. Just a look between them is enough to speak volumes. Paul, in his first television role, has a career-making performance in Normal People.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>#blackAF (Netflix) — April 17<br></strong>#blackAF is the funniest comedy of the year so far. <strong>Kenya Barris</strong>, the Emmy-nominated creator of black-ish, stars in the Netflix series that’s loosely inspired by his life.&nbsp;<strong>Rashida Jones</strong> has never been better and her chemistry with Kenya is pure comedic perfection.

You know that getting wrapped up in Daniel and Noa’s love story is going to be a fun ride, so just hop on. In addition to the romance aspect, Daniel’s family is charming and so darn lovable.</p><p><strong>Defending Jacob (Apple TV+) — April 24<br>Chris Evans</strong> is in a TV show and plays a dad — need we say more?
