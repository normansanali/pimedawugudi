Police said that Child Protective Services is conducting its own investigation of the incident.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Fox 8</a>, Pearson and Little are family&nbsp;friends who were babysitting the children. Their mother was shocked by the video and her friends’ actions telling Fox that she “trusted them.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-187410 alt="Michaela Pearson Candice Little" width=696 height=375 data-sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/michaela-pearson-candice-little.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-187410 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>WRAL</span><span class=caption-body>Left: Michaela Pearson, Right: Candice Little</span></p><p>The children’s mother has not revealed her name because she has been receiving&nbsp;death threats regarding&nbsp;the incident.

Bond is set at $150,000 each and they are currently scheduled to appear in court on Sept. 13.</p><p>According to the Winston-Salem Journal, a third suspect, 20-year-old Christopher Daquan Nettles, was arrested at the motel by police while they arrested Pearson and Little. Nettles was arrested on an unrelated warrant and his bond is set at $2,000.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not the only case where children have been videoed smoking illegal substances while in the hands of caretakers.</p><p>In March 2018, a 20-year-old mother in Raleigh, N.C. was arrested after a viral video showed her <a href=# rel=noopener>one-year-old daughter smoking marijuana</a>. In the video, an adult’s hand can be seen putting a cigarillo up to the baby’s mouth who then appears to inhale and puff smoke.</p><p>In the case of the three children from Winston-Salem, the reason why the women made the children smoke the illegal substance is still unclear.</p><p>Next, read about the parents who had their child taken away from them because they <a href=#>gave him marijuana</a> for his seizures.
