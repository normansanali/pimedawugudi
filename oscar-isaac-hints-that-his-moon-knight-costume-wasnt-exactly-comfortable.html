From what we’ve seen in the trailers, the anti-hero’s white hooded uniform has been given a pitch-perfect update for the screen, with its layered, complex design calling back to the Ancient Egyptian origins of Moony’s powers.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>But, although the costume looks great on film, spare a thought for Oscar Isaac trapped inside it when watching. The former Star Wars star opened up about the struggles of fitting into his super-suit while attending the Moon Knight premiere this week. Going by what he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook.com</a>, the full costume wasn’t the most comfortable thing to wear.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>“I would not describe it as slipping into it,” Isaac said when asked what it was like to slip into the suit. “More like wedged, stuffed, and squeezed into it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FNgBHPNVkAcBbHi.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FNgBM6aVQAEGxOl.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FNgBM7HVkAEAw4T.jpg><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Donning a superhero costume is much harder work than most people realize, with Robert Pattinson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">previously discussing</a> his troubles acting in the cape and cowl on The Batman. We know that one of the three Spideys in Spider-Man: No Way Home had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a false behind fitted into their spandex</a> (though no one is saying who).</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>The unfortunate thing is this isn’t even the first time Isaac has had to deal with wearing a restrictive costume in a comic book flick. He once played blue-skinned mutant god Apocalypse on X-Men: Apocalypse, which required him to be covered in prosthetics from head to toe, meaning he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">couldn’t so much as sit down</a>.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>The upside this time is that Marc Spector has so many different facets to his personality that Oscar Isaac didn’t have to wear the full suit for the whole six-episode shoot. We’ll see him in action when Moon Knight makes its Disney Plus debut in just a few days on March 30.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ywv8KaqWaho5aupHnHoqWtq12ptaLAjKGgrGWdpLyvecqnoKCgpGKwsL%2FTrqSeZaeWwK%2FAjJ6vmpukocZur86mnaiqpJavrbGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./virgil-abloh-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Off-White Designer Virgil Abloh Survived by Wife, Two Kids</span></a>
