In Jewish tradition, there are three kinds of fasts: statutory public fasts that come every year (like Yom Kippur and Tisha B‚ÄôAv), special public fasts decreed in times of calamity, and private fasts. Private fasts were often observed in times of threat or danger, to display piety or to mark lifecycle events.
Fasting is an ancient rite that was often used to express devoutness, induce visions, express sorrow, mourning or asceticism or as an aid in preparation for revelation or for a sacred meal.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Judy Garland Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Jul 29, 2024</time>
