OG Parker just dropped a new single with Ty Dolla $ign and Muni Long, the sultry R&B cut "Still Work." Moreover, the track is built on hazy and pretty indistinct vocal samples that form a cloudy atmosphere. Unsurprisingly, both R&B singers give impressive vocal performances and captivating melody switch-ups. Furthermore, this track follows singles like "No Fuss" and "Rain Down" ahead of Parker's next project, Moments. Also, the track's music video employs a nostalgic vibe with a love story to represent the song's longing themes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Princess Diana Elizabeth Arden Cream Is Still Available Today</h2><time>Jul 5, 2024</time>

Any collaboration between Rihanna and Drake was going to be special, and "Work" certainly does not disappoint. The only thing better than listening to the song is seeing the pair perform it together, which they did at the BRIT Awards to the delight of fans everywhere. Rihanna and Drake are both legendary, and, even if they'd sung a shopping list out loud, it would've been awesome as far as I'm concerned.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/172/>← Prev Page</a>
