The brand’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">wrinkle-smoothing patches</a>, spiked with targeted skincare ingredients delivered by tiny dissolving microneedles, smooth wrinkles.

Packed with sebum-squelching ingredients, including physical and chemical exfoliants, the formula minimizes the appearance of large pores by removing dead skin, debris, and excess oil. Kaolin clay draws dirt from packed pores, while a blend of five exfoliating acids slough dead skin cells from the surface, thus preventing future blockage. Beta hydroxy acid, one of the five acids, is uniquely capable of breaking apart oily buildup, like. sebum and oil. As for physical exfoliation, the stick features a slight, satisfying roughness that’s just enough to gently loosen and slough dead skin cells.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-peace-out-retinol-eye-stick></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Peace Out Retinol Eye Stick</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Peace Out&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The skin around the eyes is among the most delicate, making it particularly prone to creasing and laxity. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Retinol</a>, an uncontestedly excellent anti-ager, can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, including around the eye area — though the vitamin A derivative is notoriously irritating. This balm-based, swipeable solid relies on encapsulated retinol, which is typically gentler — at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>highest strength available over the counter</a>, to ensure maximum efficacy.

Retinol, a wrinkle warrior, smooths, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>vitamin C</a> protects skin from skin-aging free radicals in the environment. To use, simply place a strip directly over the wrinkle you’d like to smooth; the microneedles create tiny, imperceptible channels in the skin, which allow maximum absorption of the aforementioned ingredients. One shopper says their “deeper 11 lines” are “diminished” post-use.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-peace-out-dark-spots-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Peace Out Dark Spots Serum</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Peace Out</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Packed with a powerhouse of skin-brightening ingredients, this serum rapidly decreases the appearance of dark spots, including sun-induced and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kojic acid</a> and vitamin C brighten, while an impressive 10 percent concentration of alpha hydroxy acids gently resurface the skin to promote a fresher complexion.
