Police were called to the scene and an investigation is currently underway. <a href=#>TMZ</a> was the first to report the crash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pete-Davidson-and-Girlfriend-Chase-Sui-Wonders-Involved-in-Car-Accident-2.jpg><p>“The structure of the house is damaged tremendously,” the owner of the home exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, March 6, adding that Davidson’s Mercedes was totaled. “It was very dramatic.”</p><p>The property owner went on to say that only his 16-year-old daughter was home at the time of the incident, which occurred around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday. “Accidents can happen,” he told Us, noting that no one — including Davidson and Wonders — was “physically injured” by the crash. “The main thing for me is they are OK,” the owner continued. “We don’t think it’s safe [to be in the house].”</p><p>The duo didn’t say what caused the accident, per the homeowner, who said his daughter was “in shock” and didn’t ask many questions. “They gave their phone number of a manager and said the manager will take care of it,” he told Us, adding that a car came to pick Davidson and Wonders up after the incident.</p><p>Earlier that day, the comedian and his Bodies Bodies Bodies costar were photographed in Hawaii packing on the PDA. The duo were spotted on the beach in Kauai sharing a smooch in photos obtained by the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>The Meet Cute actor and the On the Rocks star first sparked romance rumors in December 2022 when they attended a hockey game with their Bodies Bodies Bodies costar <strong>Rachel Sennott</strong>. At the time, however, Davidson was still linked to <a href=#><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></a>.</p><p>Later that month, Us Weekly confirmed that the Suicide Squad star and the supermodel, 31, <a href=#>called it quits after less than two months</a> of dating.</p><p>In January, the Staten Island native and Wonders <a href=#>were spotted grabbing a bite to eat in New York City</a>. At one point, the Harvard University graduate put her arm around Davidson as they watched something on his cell phone.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Days later, the duo made headlines <a href=#>when they visited Universal Studios Hollywood together</a>. In a video obtained by TMZ, the Detroit native and the King of Staten Island actor shared a kiss while riding an escalator. They were later seen holding hands while riding Revenge of the Mummy.</p><p>The Guy Code alum and Wonders connected in May 2021 when they filmed Bodies Bodies Bodies, which also starred <strong>Lee Pace</strong>, <strong>Amandla Stenberg</strong> and <strong>Maria Bakalova</strong>. “Pete and Chase had insane chemistry on set,” <a href=#>an insider exclusively told Us of the pair</a> in February. “As well as when the cameras weren’t rolling.”</p><p>The source added that the twosome hang out “all the time” but weren’t ready to go public with their romance. The duo have “overnight dates, cook together and go out together,” the insider told Us, adding that Davidson and Wonders are “absolutely in some kind of relationship but aren’t open about it yet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYq6vsIycn5qrlWLAtrWMsKannJWnwG61za%2Bmpa6VmXqquoycmKtlkZiwqrDEp6to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./otto-farrant.html><span>←</span><span>Otto Farrant - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</span></a>
