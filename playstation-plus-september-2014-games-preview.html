Once again, two of the free games will be brand new to the PlayStation Store which is great perk for PlayStation owners.</p><h2>PlayStation 4</h2><h3>Velocity 2X</h3><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8455/velocity_2x-screenshot-02-ps4-us-08may14_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The first game for PS4 owners is one of the games that is brand new to the store. Velocity 2X is a sequal to Velocity Ultra, and comes from the developer FuturLab. This space based game lets you pilot the Quarp Jet again in space combat. The original game received very favorable reviews, so let’s hope the sequel can live up to that name. Velocity 2X will also be available on the PS Vita.</p><p>“Use the Quarp Drive teleport to outsmart the evil Vokh in race-tuned space combat, then dock your ship, jump out and continue the fight on foot! Velocity 2X is the visually dazzling action packed sequel to Velocity Ultra, featuring amazing puzzle-platforming action alongside award-winning shooter gameplay!”</p><h3>Sportsfriends</h3><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8455/sportsfriends-screenshot-05-ps4-ps3-us-06May14_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The next game comes from Danish indie developer Die Gute Fabrik. Sportsfriends was released in May 2014, and is a collection of mini-games which include BaraBaraBall, Hokra, Super Pole Riders, and Johann Sebastian Joust. This local multiplayer game received a 82 Metascore, and 7.3 User Score on Metacritic, and this game is also available on the PS3.</p><p>“Sportsfriends is a compendium of award-winning local multiplayer games for living rooms, parties, and even backyards. Featuring: retro-styled fighting game BaraBariBall, QWOP-like pole vault dueling game Super Pole Riders, high-velocity sports game Hokra, and face-to-face physical party game Johann Sebastian Joust. All the games are playable with the DualShock®4 wireless controller, while Johann Sebastian Joust can be further enhanced by the PlayStation Move Motion Controller (sold separately).”</p><h2>PlayStation 3</h2><h3>PlayStation All Stars Battle Royale</h3><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8455/All%20Star%20Battle%20Royale_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The first game from the PS3 owners is PlayStation All Stars Battle Royale from developers SuperBot Entertainment in conjunction with SCE Santa Monica Studio. This fighting game was first launched November 20th, 2012, and allows up to four players to battle using, as you guessed from the name, PlayStation All Star characters such as Kratos from God of War and Rachet and Clank. This game received a 74 Metascore and 7.5 User score on Metacritic. PlayStation All Stars Battle Royale is also available on the PS Vita.</p><p>“From Kratos to Sly Cooper, Sweet Tooth to Parappa the Rapper, Sony characters from all over the gaming spectrum are brought together in a fighting adventure that’s both easy to play, and hard to master. Take the battle online for competitive multiplayer action, or go head to head with a group of friends on the couch and prove once and for all who’s really the best!”</p><h3>Hoard</h3><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8455/Hoard_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Originally launched on the PS3 on November 2nd, 2010, Hoard was developed by Big Sandwich Games Inc. This action-strategy game combines a shooter with a real time strategy game. Hoard won the IGN award for “Best Quick Fix” in 2010, and scored a 75 Metascore and 6.1 User Score on Metacritic.</p><p>“HOARD is an innovative fast-paced arcade action-strategy title from Big Sandwich Games that puts you in control of conquering a medieval kingdom. Your goal is to build a giant pile of gold to sleep on in your lair. YOU ARE THE DRAGON: Scare villages! Burn castles! Collect treasure! Roast pesky knights and thieves! Compete or co-operate with other dragons in epic multiplayer battles!”</p><h2>PlayStation Vita</h2><h3>Joe Danger</h3><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8455/Joe%20Danger_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The first game for the PS Vita is the second game on this list that will be new to the Vita store in September. Independent developer Hello Games first launched this game in 2010 for the PS3, and combines the racing and platform genres. The PS3 version scored an impressive 86 Metascore and 7.7 User Score on Metacritic, so hopefully the Vita port will live up to the original.</p><p>“Take Joe on a ride from zero to hero in a game that lives up to its big brother with no compromises. Eye-popping super-smooth 60FPS graphics use only the very brightest colours on Vita’s lovely screen, and we’ve revamped the JD control scheme so it plays just as nicely, too, including touch controls for the editor modes!”</p><h3>TxK</h3><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8455/TxK_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The final game for the Vita comes from developer Llamasoft. Originaly released on the Vita on February 11th, 2014, TxK is a spiritual successor to the Atari game Tempest and features great visuals and sounds. TxK received an 84 Metascore, and 7.9 User Score on Metacritic.</p><p>“Glowing vectors, explosive particle effects and a pulse-pounding soundtrack are core elements of many modern arcade shooters – a style that Llamasoft defined with its seminal 90s tube shooter. TxK is the spiritual successor to that genre-defining work and brings you 100 levels of engrossing score-chasing gameplay, married to an outstanding soundtrack that will have your head nodding as you blast your way onto the scoreboards.”</p><p>PlayStation has done a good thing for its users to offer new to the store games alongside classics which PlayStation Plus members may already own, and it makes for a great value add. It is also great to see them offer the game on multiple platforms at the same time if it is available. This month may not be the strongest for AAA content, but as always there is a good mix of classic games with new. If you missed <a href=#>last month’s games</a>, be sure to pick them up soon before they are gone.</p><p>Source:<br><a href=#>PlayStation Blog</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIV1gZRop6WZqajBosDIqKVmqJyqwG6%2FxKmrnqWSmr9ufo9qa2afkaKytHnPq5yvoZWs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./payal-rohatgi-2.html><span>←</span><span>Payal Rohatgi (Actress) Height, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
