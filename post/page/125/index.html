Sticking by your friends! Actress Melissa Sagemiller posted a photo with Sophia Bush on Tuesday, December 11, just one day after Bush gave a very revealing interview about why she left Chicago P.D. Sagemiller, 44, was originally cast as a regular on the NBC drama but left during pre-production; her character was killed off on the series premiere.
“Thank you @sophiabush. Even in the beginning eps spent in Chicago PD, I knew it was a hard place for a breastfeeding mom of 2 babies,” she captioned the Instagram pic of the girls together.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>[Completed] LF: DLC Scarlet Exclusive Paradox Pokmon</h2><time>Jul 29, 2024</time>

One of the top big men coming out of the 2024 NBA Draft is Donovan Clingan. The star center out of the UConn basketball program has popped off and surpassed Dan Hurley’s expectations despite being a freshman back in 2022-23. He then proceeded to retain his high level of intensity on the court in his second year which led to an even higher NIL valuation. All of this prompted the Portland Trail Blazers to acquire him as a key part of their rebuild post-Damian Lillard.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dr. Ebonie Vincent Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, married, Kids and Net Worth</h2><time>Jul 29, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../is-baking-soda-the-same-as-baking-powder.html></a>
The bottom line
While both products appear similar, they're certainly not the same. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, which requires an acid and a liquid to become activated and help baked goods rise. Conversely, baking powder includes sodium bicarbonate, as well as an acid. It only needs a liquid to become activated. Can I use baking soda in place of baking powder? Keep in mind that baking soda has three times the power of baking powder, so 1/3 teaspoon of baking soda is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of baking powder.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/124/>← Prev Page</a>
