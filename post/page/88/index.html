Do not call Jason X a horror film. The only definition where Jason X is a horror film is “movie that involves gore,” and that’s obviously too broad to use as a requisite for the horror genre. Instead, it’s more accurate to call Jason X a sci-fi action comedy that uses the Jason Voorhees premise and decides to shoot it into space for laughs. If you’re someone that genuinely loves the Friday the 13th series, I imagine that Jason X is a bit of an affront as it refuses to take anything about the franchise seriously.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jennifer Lawrence Says Ex Nicholas Hoult Hated When She Did This</h2><time>Aug 19, 2024</time>

[Verse 1]
I remember the sickness was forever
I remember snuff videos
Cold Septembers, the distances we covered
The fistfightson the beach
TheBizzies round us up
Do it allagain next week
An embryonic love
The first time that it scarred
Embarrassyourselfforsomeone
Cryin’ like achild
And the boywho kicked Tom’s head in
Still bugs me now
That’s the thing, it lingers
And claws you when you’re down
