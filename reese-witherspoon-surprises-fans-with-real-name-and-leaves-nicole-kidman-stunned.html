"My other favorite thing is that I called Dern when we were shooting Big Little Lies', Reese shared. Nicole, expressing her dislike for the nickname, interrupted, "I hate how you call her Dern though. It sounds weird. I'm always like, 'Laura' and you're like, 'no, Dern, Dern, Dern'."</p><p id=eVTq75fXlPk data-wc=32>Reese then clarified, "Do you know why? Because my name is Laura and her name is Laura, and it's confusing to me."

Nicole quickly pointed out, "But she doesn't call you Laura, though." Reese, with a playful tone, replied, "I don't understand your point, I don't like your tone, you're trying to understand something." Nicole then jokingly said she would "stay out of it."</p><p id=ejaTWkK3ggI data-wc=61>This amusing exchange left fans in a state of surprise and delight. Social media was abuzz with reactions to the revelation. One fan wrote, "I was today years old when I found out Reese’s real name is Laura lmao."
