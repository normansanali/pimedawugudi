Hilarious and dotted with characters oozing teenage effervescence, this heist comedy is set in the natural beauty of a reservation in Oklahoma where their lives have been shaped by tragedy and the socio-cultural dynamics of their community. The show features an almost entirely Indigenous cast and production team and has been praised for its groundbreaking narrative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reservation Dogs follows a quartet of Native American teenagers who harbor dreams of leaving for California to make a better life but must first engage in small-time local criminality to save up enough money for their trip. They also must survive a turf war against a ruthless rival gang to break away from the prevalent cycle of addiction and poverty. The series is created by <a href=#><strong>Sterlin Harjo</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Thor: Love and Thunder director Taika Waititi</strong></a>. We've put together this handy guide that goes into detail about the most important characters and the actors who play them. So, shall we begin then?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/reservation-dogs.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="‘Reservation Dogs’ Is At Its Best When Focusing on the Authentic Representation of Native People">‘Reservation Dogs’ Is At Its Best When Focusing on the Authentic Representation of Native People</a></span></p><h2 id=d-39-pharaoh-woon-a-tai-as-bear-smallhill>D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai as Bear Smallhill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reservation-dogs-dpharaoh-woon-a-tai.jpg><p>Bear sees himself as the leader of the gang despite a lack of consensus on his leadership or the need for it. Tender-hearted, self-aware, and compassionate, Bear was raised by his mum and longs to reconnect with his estranged dad who now lives in Los Angeles. His craving for a male role model drives him to engage in a comical interaction with a spirit guide who tries to hap his core values.</p><p>Woon-A-Tai had his acting breakthrough as Chase Whaley in Season 1 of the 2018 Family Channel series <strong>Holly Hobbie</strong>. Since then, he has gone on to star as Lucky in <strong>Creeped Out </strong>and Mikey in the Canadian TV crime drama series<strong> Tribal</strong>. He played the role of Hank with distinction in the film <strong>Beans</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=devery-jacobs-as-elora-danan-postoak><a href=#>Devery Jacobs</a> as Elora Danan Postoak</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/devery.jpg><p>Elora embodies the conscientiousness and ruthlessness required for the pack to survive. While she may not be one to talk about leadership, she leads by example, the one on whose shoulders the real gravitas for rallying the troops rests. Elora is blessed with a cold resolve that belies her age. After losing her mother at the age of three, she carries the scars of her loss like a badge of honor and is determined to break away from the hold of the Reservation into a better life. This role is played by <strong>Devery Jacobs</strong>, a Mohawk actress who is best known for her performance in the 2013 drama <strong>Rhymes for Young Ghouls </strong>and her role as <a href=#><strong>Sam Black Crow in American Gods</strong></a>. She played Tina in <strong>Cold</strong>, Miranda in <strong>This Life</strong>, Britney in <strong>The Lie</strong>, and Lilith Bathory in <strong>The Order</strong> (2019-2020).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paulina-alexis-as-willie-jack>Paulina Alexis as Willie Jack</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/reservation-dogs-paulina-alexis.jpg><p>Known for her witty remarks and quotable jabs, Willie is the cool kid of the pack. Her urban native era hats stand her out as the most stylish of the bunch with a personality that brings the much-needed color and panache to an often stoic team. Willie is also the most eccentric of the lot, having a thing for the supernatural when she asks Elora's uncle to put a curse on Jackie. Much of the next season will focus on her family life and the dynamics between her and her father.</p><p>Alexis’s first big gig was a role in <a href=#><strong>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</strong></a>. She also appeared in the 2020 Canadian drama film Beans.</p><h2 id=lane-factor-as-cheese>Lane Factor as Cheese</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/reservation-dogs-lance-factor.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cheese is the youngest member of the gang and his naivety and inexperience are on display all too often. However, like a little brother, the rest of the crew is fiercely protective of him. Laid back and fun-loving, you can tell he is learning the ropes fast and is eager to join in all the brewing mischief. Not yet assertive, expect him to grow into his own in the coming seasons. Cheese despite his age has an uncanny way of connecting with the adults on the show. Factor's appearance in Reservation Dogs is the actor's TV debut. He is billed to feature in <a href=#><strong>Steven Spielberg’s coming-of-age drama The Fabelmans</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=sarah-podemski-as-rita>Sarah Podemski as Rita</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/reservation-dogs-sarah-podemski.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rita is Bear's mother.
