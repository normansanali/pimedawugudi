One year at the annual Disneyland Christmas parade, Walt Disney's grandchildren were supposed to ride in a horse drawn carriage with him. Parade time was approaching and his grandchildren had not yet shown up. Disney called <a href=#>Don DeFore</a> in a panic and asked if he could borrow two of his children, because he couldn't ride in the parade without kids in his carriage. So DeFore generously offered up two of his kids, Ronnie and his sister <a href=#>Dawn DeFore</a> to ride in the carriage that year with Walt Disney, and they dutifully waved to the crowd. This is a fond childhood memory of the two.</p><p>Ronnie DeFore was born on August 25, 1950 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Ronald Holmes DeFore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfp7yvusieZJ2dlqS%2Fpg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./144161-rihannas-work-lyrics-have-a-double-meaning-that-you-dont-want-to-miss.html><span>←</span><span>Rihanna's &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; Lyrics Have A Double Meaning That You Don't Want To Miss</span></a>
