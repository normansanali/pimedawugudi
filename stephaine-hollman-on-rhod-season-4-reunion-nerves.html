“I feel good. I’m not that anxious or nervous. … Normally I would be a mess, but I feel good,” the 39-year-old Bravo star told Us Weekly exclusively on Wednesday, December 4, the day before the taping. “I kind of know where I stand with everything. For me, it’s a weird feeling because I always have, kind of, second guessed myself and gone in and have not really had strong convictions about how I feel or I have not wanted to express them, but this year I feel very strong, for some reason."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I’m not that anxious or nervous. … Normally I would be a mess, but I feel good,” the 39-year-old Bravo star told Us Weekly exclusively on Wednesday, December 4, the day before the taping. “I kind of know where I stand with everything. For me, it’s a weird feeling because I always have, kind of, second guessed myself and gone in and have not really had strong convictions about how I feel or I have not wanted to express them, but this year I feel very strong, for some reason. And watch me crumble at the reunion, you never know. But, I do. I think I realize it’s not the end of the world if something bad happens.”</p><p>According to the seating chart released by Bravo on Thursday, Stephaine will be in hot seat next to host <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen.</strong></a> The Oklahoma native’s frenemy <strong>Kameron Westcott</strong> is in the spot next to the boss on the other side of the couch. (<strong>LeeAnne Locken </strong>and<strong> Brandi Redmond</strong> are also on Stephaine’s couch, while<strong> Kary Brittingham </strong>and<strong> D’Andra Simmons</strong>&nbsp;fill out Kameron’s couch.)</p><p>“I talked to Brandi almost every day, and Kary Brittingham, I talked to her a lot,” Stephaine told Us on Wednesday. “I haven’t talked to LeeAnne lately and D’Andra, occasionally. Everyone’s just busy, I feel like. And then, I’ve not spoken to Kameron since Fashion Week at all, so she’s the one person I feel like I have stuff to talk about from the season, but we don’t speak at all.”</p><p>While Stephaine concluded that she isn’t “nervous to see” Kameron, she is ready to move on.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m just excited to get past this chapter of our friendship, whether it’s move forward or stay where we are,” she noted. “It’s fine either way.”</p><p>For more from Stephaine, who is holding a contest titled Hollman Helps – High School Edition with her husband, Travis, for High Schools in the U.S. to have the opportunity to have their lockers transformed, watch the video above!</p><p>The Real Housewives of Dallas airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqtnaCdrqq6xGafqKScoq6vec6nZKugn5l6tLHArKanZWRiv6bBzaKmp2Wemr%2B3sdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-shiloh-jolie-forgive-pitt-brad-pitt.html><span>←</span><span>Shiloh Jolie Pitt Forgave Dad Brad Pitt, But Fans Think There's More To The Story</span></a>
