He continued to sell short stories until the fourth novel he ever wrote, Carrie, was accepted for publishing by Doubleday in 1973. Thus began a long, distinguished career that includes classics like ‘Salem’s Lot, Stand by Me, The Dark Tower books, Cujo, Firestarter, The Green Mile, and It. Recently, he’s built a social media following that embraces his frank and oftentimes hilarious takes on mainstream culture.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>A deist? Stephen King? Based on natural religion, deism is the discovery of religious truths through reasoning rather than through scripture or via the prophets. That’s the simple answer for it.
