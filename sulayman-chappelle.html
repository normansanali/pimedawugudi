However, unlike other celebrity kids, Sulayman is kept far away from social media and rarely appears on paparazzi's camera.</p><h2>Sulayman's Parents Career</h2><p>Chappelle is still young and attending school to complete his early studies. There's plenty of time for Sulayman to build up his career.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to his father, Dave Chappelle, he is globally famous as a comedian. Moreover, he is also known as a screenwriter, actor, and producer. He made his career breakthrough from one of his all-time hit shows named <i>Chappelle's Show</i>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/6/8/Chappelle33-1559974680721.jpg><p>Sulayman's father has also portrayed in various movies including, <i>The Nutty Professor, Undercover Brother, Mel Brook's Robin Hood: Men in Tights, Con Air, You've Got Mail</i>,and many more.</p><p>In the year 2016, Dave signed a comedy-special contract worth <strong>$20 million</strong> with <i>Netflix</i>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Sulayman Dating Anyone?</h2><p>Junior Chappelle is still single.

Only their loved ones and close friends attended the marriage ceremony. Before getting married, the pair dated for months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/3/22/elaone-1616421592792.JPG><p>So far, the couple is silent on how they met each other. There are also not many details about their weddings. As of now, Mr. and Mrs. Chappelle are sharing a healthy bond as a perfect married partner.&nbsp;</p><p>The married pair is celebrating their 10-years of marriage anniversary blissfully without involving in any controversies regarding their separation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/6/8/chappelle4444-1559974700277.jpg><p>From the strong marital bond, Elaine and her husband Dave shared three kids, sons Sulayman, <a href=#><strong>Ibrahim Chappelle</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and a daughter named <a href=#><strong>Sonal Chappelle</strong></a>. The husband-wife duo is parenting their kids jointly.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sulayman Chapelle's Net Worth And Salary</h2><p>Chappelle has not started his career yet. So, there is no chance for him to make his own money. However, he is living a lavish celebrity life, as his father has an enormous amount of net worth and salary.&nbsp;</p><p>As of early 2021, Dave Chappelle's total wealth is more than<strong> $50 million</strong>. Being born to a millionaire family, Sulayman is surely relishing the considerable bank balance of his father. As a son, he is a rightful heir to Dave's property.
