In the second, she plays Josie Radek, a depressive, intense astrophysicist, while in MIB, she plays the powerful and super-cool investigator Molly who pairs up with Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) to solve a high-profile murder case.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I feel really lucky in my career to have gotten to play the kind of protagonist as a Black woman that we don't necessarily always see," Thompson says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her commitment to diversity in the film industry spans beyond the way she chooses her acting roles. Last year, Thompson launched Viva Maude, a production company dedicated to developing "inclusive stories with inventive creators." Its announced projects include adaptations of Who Fears Death, the critically acclaimed Africanfuturist novel by Nnedi Okorafor, and The Secret Lives of Church Ladies, the 2020 National Book Awards finalist by Deesha Philyaw. There are also plans for an HBO series based on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a33501867/raven-leilani-luster-zadie-smith/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Luster class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Luster</a>, the sensational debut novel by Raven Leilani about a Black New York City woman who involves herself in a couple's open marriage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"How do we create worlds where the kind of protagonists that we don't often get to see get to take up space?" Thompson muses. As an actor and producer, she wants "folks of color" and those who are "queer" or otherwise "marginalized inside of Hollywood" to be put on the big screen, front and center.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This year, Thompson herself continues to be a protagonist. The star returns as Valkyrie in the newly released Marvel film, Thor: Love and Thunder, again opposite Chris Hemsworth.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
