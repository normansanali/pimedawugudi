The threats were reportedly made because Judge Chutkan is presiding over the trial of former President Donald Trump. Abigail Jo Shry is accused of leaving a threatening voicemail where she expressed her intention to harm anyone opposing Trump and made violent threats against the judge.</p><p>The voice message contained the following threats: “If Trump doesn’t get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you…You will be targeted personally, publicly, your family, all of it.”</p><p></p><p>Former President Donald Trump is facing legal proceedings related to allegations of attempting to interfere with the 2020 elections and his alleged role in inciting the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p><p>Abigail Jo Shry has been indicted for misdemeanor threat causing fear of imminent serious bodily injury. She is scheduled to appear for a bond hearing on September 13. Court documents suggest that Shry has a history of making death threats against politicians, with four similar charges brought against her in the past year.</p><p>In addition to threatening Judge Chutkan, Shry is also accused of threatening Texas Democrat Representative Sheila Jackson Lee. Texas authorities traced the threats back to Shry’s residence in Alvin. After officials spoke to her on August 5, Shry confessed to making the threats and used racial slurs against the officers.</p><p>While Shry stated that she would not actively travel to Washington, DC, to carry out an attack, she indicated that she might target Sheila Jackson Lee if she were to visit Alvin. Judge Chutkan asserted that the threats will not impact the proceedings. On August 11, she imposed a protection order to limit the release of information by both prosecutors and Donald Trump’s legal team.</p><p>Judge Chutkan also cautioned Donald Trump against conducting online smear campaigns aimed at defaming prosecutors or inciting his followers during the trial. She emphasized that he, like any other criminal defendant, would have restrictions in place throughout the proceedings.</p><p>The case against Abigail Jo Shry is currently ongoing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kwabEwKxksKedlrturdGrnKyslZl6p7vRZquhqpWWwaa6yKeeZqKlmbSmeceeqZ6rXay1osCMnaCdZZGXtqityKVko6ddqLWzxYydpmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./take-a-nap-or-a-shower-at-charlotte-airport.html><span>←</span><span>Take a nap or a shower at Charlotte airport WSOC TV</span></a>
