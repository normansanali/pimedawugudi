The Season 7 finale, "<a href=#>Run</a>." Picking up exactly where "Hit" left off, the episode starts with Will being held hostage by the Queen and her newly revealed accomplice (who, surprise, was inside the bank all along). The Queen forces Will to drive her to his house, where JJ's son Henry is located, and clearly has evil plans for both of them. Thankfully, those plans are interrupted by the arrival of the Behavioral Analysis Unit, who has been furiously trying to track them down all along. Despite the drama, the episode ends on a happy note, with the wedding of JJ and Will.</p><p dir=ltr>The episode also marks the final one for Emily Prentiss (played by Paget Brewster). Though she was technically fired at the end of Season 5, due to various contractual obligations, Brewster stayed on through the end of Season 7. She told the <a href=#>AV Club</a>&nbsp;that leaving was heartbreaking at first, especially because she was essentially let go because a higher-up wanted other women to replace her and A.J. Cook. However, she eventually felt that it was the best thing for her personally as she realized she loved "everyone here, but I realize now, having left, that my heart isn't in it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2ppboNxe9OhnGaalajBbrHPoqqonJWoerCyjJypoqWZo66tecyipZ2rXZrDpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephaine-hollman-on-rhod-season-4-reunion-nerves.html><span>←</span><span>Stephaine Hollman on RHOD Season 4 Reunion Nerves</span></a>
