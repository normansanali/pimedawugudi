This time around, though, Emperor Uriel Septim VII isn’t there to save them. Instead, their execution is interrupted by a surprise dragon attack, which leads them to learn that they are the Last Dragonborn: a person gifted with dragon blood, and the only hero who can save Skyrim from a draconic apocalypse.</p><p>To date, <strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong> is the latest entry in the franchise (chronologically speaking). The game takes place a good 200 years after the events of <strong>Oblivion</strong>, and the world has changed significantly. The once-strong empire has lost so much power that half of the province of Skyrim wants to secede and is embroiled in a civil war against the half that doesn’t. Needless to say, it isn’t a great time to be alive. Even Sheogorath has gone missing, and his servant, Dervenin (who last appeared in <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles</strong>) is looking for him. At least Ulfar the Unending, who showed up in <strong>The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon</strong>, is having the time of his afterlife in Sovngarde.</p><p>Like the two previous entries before it, <strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong> received multiple pieces of DLC, two of which were story-oriented: <strong>Dawnguard</strong> and <strong>Dragonborn</strong>. In <strong>Dawnguard</strong>, the story revolves around yet another one of the Elder Scroll’s prophecies (specifically, the disappearance of the sun). Since sunlight is one of the few things that can harm vampires, an army of undead bloodsuckers wants to make that prophecy come to fruition. players can either join them or stand against them. <strong>Dragonborn</strong>, meanwhile, takes place on a nearby island that was once ruled by the First Dragonborn and involves his resurrection. While the story is mostly self-contained, players eventually encounter Falx Carius, who initially showed up in <strong>Bloodmoon</strong>. Since then, he was promoted from Captain to General, was killed, and was eventually revived as an undead soldier. Not the promotion he was looking for.</p><h2><strong>The Elder Scrolls Travels: Stormhold and Dawnstar</strong></h2><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 31, 2003 (Stormhold) and August 26, 2004 (Dawnstar)</p><p><strong>Timeline Date: </strong>Unknown</p><p><strong>The Elder Scrolls Travels: Shadowkey</strong> was actually not the first in the <strong>Travels</strong> game created for phones. That game was predated by <strong>The Elder Scrolls Travels: Stormhold </strong>and <strong>The Elder Scrolls: Dawnstar</strong>, but good luck telling those two games apart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOrZ%2BeZZWhsaa%2BjKyaq6ecocBuwMimnKWhnpp6psLEq7Bmn5Gism61zWaaoaqfo7ytu8aimpqkXaS%2FpbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ken-nwosu-the-witches-age-wiki-biography-wife-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Ken Nwosu The Witches: Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Net Worth</span></a>
