Recommended Videos When you sit down to watch The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special, it is natural to expect the special presentation to address the long-standing question of the alternate Gamora’s absence. Although the film sorely disappoints on that front, it tries to make up for it by introducing a rather unexpected twist — though the studio had voluntarily spoiled it in advance."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Yes, we are talking about Mantis being Star-Lord aka Peter Quill’s half-sister.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>But when did this nifty little piece of development come into existence? We’ll walk you through it.</p><h2 id=h-how-is-mantis-star-lord-s-sister data-injectable=false>How is Mantis Star-Lord’s sister?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-11.jpg><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Both of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, and every other project the intergalactic team of superheroes has appeared in, have either focused on Star-Lord’s story, his romantic endeavors with Gamora, or his heroic exploits.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>But ever since MCU fans were introduced to Star-Lord’s evil daddy dearest, Ego, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</a>, many have speculated that Mantis, a hybrid empath who accompanied the villain initially, was Peter’s sister. This is due to the fact that the mighty Celestial had a hobby of siring children everywhere he went.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>The special presentation put an end to the theories by confirming that, yes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mantis and Peter are indeed siblings</a>. Peter doesn’t really have any fond memories of his father, who killed his mother and tried to end his life as well in his bid to remake the universe. Because of this, Mantis guessed telling him the truth would reduce her to being a reminder of what he had lost and gone through.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-2-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-7.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-1-1.jpg><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>This does contradict what Mantis had previously shared with Drax. Upon being asked how she ended up on Ego’s planet, she had explained that he had found her in her larvae state, all alone and orphaned on her home world, and taken her with him.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-the-peter-and-mantis-twist-was-initially-revealed data-injectable=false>How the Peter and Mantis twist was initially revealed</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by James Gunn (@jamesgunn)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>It is now evident that the story of Ego being the only one who raised her was mostly a half-truth. This has been something that has been suspected since Vol. 2 came out thanks to an Easter egg and a since-altered Instagram post.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Apparently, Ego mated with a female from the species Mantis belongs to. This was something that was noticed by fans in the many displays the Celestial presents while revealing how he tried to create another being like him. This was enough for fans to speculate whether Mantis and Peter share a familial bond.</p><h2 id=h-the-theory-was-not-initially-confirmed data-injectable=false>The theory was not initially confirmed</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true><a href=#>LOOK AT THE CAPTION</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Yashselokar</a> in<a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Though James Gunn shot down the theory at the time, the speculation was backed by a post by actress, Jennifer Sharp, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded</a> a picture of herself in Mantis-like makeup and confirmed that she had been a part of a deleted scene in the film. But the original content of the caption she framed — and swiftly changed — revealed that she was indeed supposed to play Mantis’ mother and one of Ego’s many partners.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>Evidently, the MCU and Gunn are done shooting down the very obvious assessment of fans and have finally confirmed that Mantis is indeed Peter’s half-sister. The only thing left to wonder about is why Ego, who killed every single one of his children because they didn’t have Celestial powers, didn’t subject Mantis to the same fate. The most reasonable explanation is that it was probably because she was of use to Ego. She aided in lessening the pull of his neurotic tendencies with her empathic powers, which may have been enough to spare her life.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>As Peter has warmly accepted Mantis as his sister, we can say that all’s well that ends well.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is currently streaming on Disney Plus.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmnpqllWKwqa3NoKCnn12owaK%2BjKWmq5xdlrulecyapa2ho2LBuLXSrWSipl2ptaZ5xq6Yq5yZlru0ec6fZK2glWK0orjAsbBmoJ%2BhtqWt2GaqqZ2Tnq6tecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rock-that-yields-useful-metals-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rock that yields useful metals</span></a>
