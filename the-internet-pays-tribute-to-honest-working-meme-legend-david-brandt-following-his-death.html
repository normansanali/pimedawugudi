The image in question featured him in a plaid shirt standing in front of a field. His friendly demeanor accompanied by the text made for a pretty wholesome meme.&nbsp;</p><p>Variations of the meme spread across the internet like wildfire; it was pretty much appearing everywhere for a while and still pops up today. David himself did once acknowledge the memes and admitted they were funny when he spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Inverse</a> about them. His grandson even confirmed that he’s been known to use the phrase the internet attributed to him multiple times.</p><p>Meme connoisseurs on Reddit made a tribute post for the late legend as they flocked to pay their respects. As is customary, he was photoshopped onto the stairway to heaven with other legends such as Harambe, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robin Williams</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Fisher</a> waiting for him at the top.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"><a href=#>Farewell…</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Stepbro_canhelp</a> in <a href=#>meme</a></figure><p>More tributes were made in honor of the farmer in the replies under the post. Many typed their heartfelt condolences, while others were shocked at his passing.</p><p>Farewell my dearest friend. Your work was always the most honeat work I’ve ever seen</p><p>he didnt do much but what he did was honest work</p><p>farewell</p><p>What happened ? The Honest man pass away ?</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Know Your Meme News</a> reports that the cause of Brandt’s death was caused by injuries sustained from a vehicle accident he was involved with while working on his farm on May 20th. He was 76 at the time of his death.</p><p>While his legendary status as a meme may be how he’s remembered to many, Brandt’s contributions to pioneering sustainable farming methods have made him quite a celebrity in the farming community. Brandt led research into a method of farming that avoided disturbing the soil — it was known as “no-till farming.” His methods increased crop yield and were adopted by many other farmers all over the world, especially in locations without access to modern farming tools. Brandt himself acted as a mentor in conservation to many in the farming industry.</p><p>Brandt found the memes about him amusing, but in all honesty, he was too busy educating others and researching soil health to really care too much for the internet phenomenon he found himself at the center of. Not only did he bring smiles to the faces of strangers on the internet, but he also made a positive impact on the world as a whole. It’s safe to say he will be missed by many, even those who never even met him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnGahnqmys7rErWSpmamoerW%2ByJusrZ1dqbxutM6nnKysXay8s7fIp55mpZWism64xKCcp5xdma63tcNmmauZnpnBbrLOpaOor5mjtG60yKxknZ2RqbVw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tatiana-von-furstenberg-inspires-us-go-prep-with-tanner-hall.html><span>←</span><span>Tatiana von Furstenberg Inspires Us to Go Prep with Tanner Hall</span></a>
