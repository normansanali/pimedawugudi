An anonymous viewer managed to get into contact with Menzer and her mother, and shared screenshots of chat messages. They were told to say that “what they said was all made up” and that they have to “say what they wrote.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@sunsetmakeupp href=#>@sunsetmakeupp</a><p>Replying to @hawkles01 Amber’s manipulation</p><a title="♬ original sound - Sunset Makeup" href=#>♬ original sound – Sunset Makeup</a></figure><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=false>The comments in Menzer’s response videos were filled with support for Sunset and accused the influencer of “playing the victim.” Some TikTok users wondered if some of the victims would consider getting legal action, especially due to how serious the allegations were. That hasn’t been the case as of now, and is still being viewed as a TikTok feud.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tbXKraakZaOprrN5wKaZnqpdorK7usSrZJ%2Bhnpa5rcWMmpudqpWowKa%2FjJuspaSpnruoecClo56fkam2sLrSZpinnF2brq%2B%2FjJqpnqakYrWiwsinnmahpGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tiffany-ortiz.html><span>←</span><span>Tiffany Ortz - Married, Bio, Career , Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts</span></a>
