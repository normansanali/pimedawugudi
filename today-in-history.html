The 3,106-carat diamond, weighing about 1.33 pounds, was named the Cullinan Diamond after the owner of the mine. It was cut down into nine large stones and about 100 smaller ones worth millions of dollars, many of which belong to the British royal family’s crown jewels.</p><h2>1924: Petrograd Is Renamed Leningrad</h2><p>Petrograd is renamed Leningrad five days after the death of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. The city hadn’t been called Petrograd for long — Peter the Great had named the city St. Petersburg in the 18th century, but the city was renamed Petrograd in 1914 to remove any connotation with Germany. In 1991, however, voters in Russia decided to change the city’s name again and resorted it to its old name, St. Petersburg.</p><h2>1966: The Beaumont Children Disappear In Australia</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-398284 alt="Beaumont Children" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/beaumont-children-disappearance-article.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-398284 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>To this day, no one knows what happened to the three Beaumont children.</span></p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Beaumont children</a> — nine-year-old Jane, seven-year-old Arnna, and, four-year-old Grant — disappear while on an outing to Glenelg Beach in Australia.
