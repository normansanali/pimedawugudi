In 1996, the group released "Trial by Fire," which featured Steve Perry on vocals (notably on the No. 1 adult contemporary single "When You Love a Woman" and on the rock radio hit "Message of Love"). Despite the animosity surrounding Perry's departure and the band's dissolution, it was Perry who instigated the reunion, contacting each of his old bandmates to smooth things over, rekindle friendships, and get them all involved.&nbsp;</p><p>Journey, with its prime-era lineup, was set to tour in support of "Trial by Fire," until Perry suffered a medical emergency on a hike in Hawaii, during a 10-day getaway before rehearsals, according to <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>GQ</a>. "I got to the top of this hill, and I was in trouble. I could hardly walk. I don't know what had happened, but the pain was like an ice pick. I'd had some pain in my left hip area before, but I didn't think nothin' about it." Some tests and doctor consultations revealed that Perry needed a complete hip replacement — which would take him off of any Journey world tour.</p><p>Perry allowed the rest of the band to tour, with a sensitive caveat. "Call it the J-Boys. Call it anything. But don't call it Journey, y'know? Because I am gonna get this done, eventually." Instead, they hired a new singer, hit the road as Journey, and it upset Perry so much that it re-fractured the carefully reformed band.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kmpwbWxmZMGzrcaimmaclamuqrjSZpibp6Wpequ71KulnrFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-wiggles-star-emma-watkins-announces-engagement-to-boyfriend-of-one-year-oliver-brian.html><span>←</span><span>The Wiggles star Emma Watkins announces engagement to boyfriend of one year Oliver Brian</span></a>
