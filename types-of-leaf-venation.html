Complete answer: Parallel <b>venation is found</b> in the <b>Banana</b> plant.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-leaf-venation-short-answer></span>What is leaf Venation short answer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Leaf venation</b> is the arrangement of veins in lamina of the <b>leaf</b>. Two types of <b>venation</b> are reticulate <b>venation</b> and parallel <b>venation</b>. When the veins are irregularly distributed to form a channel, it is known as reticulate <b>venation</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-leaf-venation-definition></span>What is leaf Venation definition?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The arrangement of veins in a <b>leaf</b> is called the <b>venation</b> pattern. Monocots and dicots differ in their patterns of <b>venation</b>. Monocots have parallel <b>venation</b> in which the veins run in straight lines across the length of the <b>leaf</b> without converging.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-leaf-venation></span>What is leaf Venation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Venation</b> is the pattern of veins in the blade of a <b>leaf</b>. The veins consist of vascular tissues which are important for the transport of food <b>and</b> water. <b>Leaf</b> veins connect the blade to the petiole, <b>and</b> lead from the petiole to the stem.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-reticulate-venation-with-diagram></span>What is reticulate Venation with diagram?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Reticulate venation</b> refers to the arrangement of veins in a leaf where they form a web-like structure. For example, mango and rose leaves; their veins form a network.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-reticulate-venation-example></span>What is reticulate venation example?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Reticulate venation</b> – <b>Reticulate venation</b> includes irregular vein arrangement for the creation of a network. <b>Examples</b>: Hibiscus, papaya, leaves of Tulsi, Coriander, China Rose, Mangifera, <b>Parallel venation</b> – <b>Parallel venation</b> means that the veins run <b>parallel</b> to each other.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-leaves-are-reticulate-venation></span>Which leaves are reticulate venation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Wheat, tulsi, maize, grass, coriander (dhania), china rose. Solution: <b>Leaves</b> of tulsi, coriander and china rose have <b>reticulate venation</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-plant-shows-reticulate-venation></span>Which plant shows reticulate venation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Therefore, <b>plants showing reticulate venation</b> is Ficus. Thus, option (A) is the correct answer.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-mango-reticulate-venation></span>Does Mango reticulate venation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>venation</b> on <b>mango</b> leaves is pinnate <b>reticulate</b>. It is distinguished by the presence of a central midrib and a swarm of small veins emanating from the midrib and spreading throughout the leaf. This is the most typical type of <b>venation</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-leaves-show-reticulate-venation-banana></span>Which leaves show reticulate venation banana?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Banana leaf</b> is a monocot <b>leaf showing parallel venation</b> . The veins are arranged <b>parallel</b> to each other and never join any other veins. There is no branching as in <b>reticulate venation</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-plant-leaves-have-parallel-venation></span>Which plant leaves have parallel venation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b><b>Plants Having Parallel Venation</b></b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>Banana.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Coconut.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Wheat.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Maize.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Most monocotyledons.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-mango-leaf-have-parallel-venation></span>Does Mango Leaf have parallel venation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Mango leaf has</b> a <b>pinnate reticulate venation</b>. It <b>is</b> characterized as a presence of a central midrib and a bunch of small veins originating from the mid rib and spread all over the <b>leaf</b>. This <b>is</b> the most common form of <b>venation</b>. Another type of <b>venation is parallel venation</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-example-of-parallel-venation></span>What is a example of parallel Venation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Parallel venation</b>: In some leaves, the veins run <b>parallel</b> to each other. Such leaves have are said to have <b>parallel venation</b>. <b>Example</b>: banana, grass and wheat.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-leaf-venation-for-class-6></span>What is leaf Venation for Class 6?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The design made by veins in a <b>leaf</b> is called the <b>leaf venation</b>. If the design is net like on both sides of midrib is called reticulate <b>venation</b>. For example: coriander, rose, oak etc.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-type-of-venation-is-sugarcane></span>Which type of venation is sugarcane?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Reticulate <b>venation</b>, capsular fruits, pentamerous flowers all are the characteristics of the dicot plants. Hence, the correct answer is option (D). Note: <b>Sugarcane</b> is monocot plants which are hybrids of tall perennial grass.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-leaf-venation-of-maize></span>What is the leaf venation of maize?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>leaves</b> of tulsi, coriander, and <b>china rose</b> have reticulate <b>venation</b>, whereas <b>maize</b>, grass, and wheat have parallel <b>venation</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-type-of-venation-does-peepal-leaf></span>Which type of Venation does Peepal Leaf?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Answer. Explanation: <b>Peepal</b> scientifically known as Ficus religiosa belongs to Moraceae family of the flowering plants. Being a dicotyledonous plant the <b>Peepal leaves</b> have reticulate <b>venation</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-shape-of-sugarcane></span>What is the shape of sugarcane?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Sugarcane</b> (Saccharum). The <b>sugarcane</b> plant produces a number of stalks that reach 3 to 7 metres (10 to 24 feet) high and bear long sword-shaped leaves. The stalks are composed of many segments, and at each joint there is a bud.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-local-name-of-sugarcane></span>What is the local name of sugarcane?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Saccharum officinarum (<b>sugarcane</b>)<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-sugarcane-a-herb-or-shrub></span>Is Sugarcane a herb or shrub?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Sugarcane</b> is a <b>plant</b>. It is not a <b>shrub</b> because <b>shrubs</b> are small plants with several branches that grow directly from the root near the ground and don’t have any main stem but <b>sugarcane</b> is a tall fibrous and edible stalk which behaves like a tall perennial grass.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46tsKmdo2K8p3nLnpifZaaau6LAyKilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samuel-kessel-found-deceased-in-letts-iowa-after-went-missing-html.html><span>←</span><span>Samuel Kessel Found Deceased In Letts, Iowa After Went Missing</span></a>
