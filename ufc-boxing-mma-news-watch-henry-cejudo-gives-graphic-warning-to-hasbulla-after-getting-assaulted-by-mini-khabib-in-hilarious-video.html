The former UFC fighter and freestyle wrestler playfully sparred with ‘Mini Khabib’, while the pint-sized sensation kept on thrashing him.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Henry Cejudo and Hasbulla Magomedov playfully fight</strong></h2><p><span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Henry Cejudo</a> recently uploaded a video clip showing his interaction with Hasbulla Magomedov on <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Instagram</a>. The video began with Cejudo messing around with ‘Mini Khabib’, while Magomedov seemingly thrashed the former mixed martial artist.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‘Triple C’ wrote in the caption, “WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.

He wrote, “why didn’t you expose where I smeared you, you expose where you hit me.” The video ended with Cejudo sitting on a chair with Magomedov on his lap, giving punch after punch.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>‘Mini Khabib’ in the UFC</strong></h2><p><span>The 19-year-old viral sensation has signed a deal with the UFC. Previously, Magomedov took to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Instagram</a> and confirmed that he signed a 5-year contract with Ultimate Fighting Championship. He wrote, “The rumors are true. I have officially signed a deal to fight in the UFC! Details will be revealed by the end of the year.” Furthermore, he took this chance to advertise the ‘Hasbulla Fight Kit’. Additionally, he thanked <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dana White</a>, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, and everyone who helped him get the contract.</span></p><p><span>The UFC president revealed the fact in an interview with Robbie Fox. White <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>said</a>, “</span><i><span>I didn’t know this was coming, but yes we did sign Hasbulla. And what he’s going to end up [whether he fights or not] doing remains to be seen.”</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Magomedov’s rivalry with Abdu Rozik makes him one of the obvious opponents. Nonetheless, UFC fans are yet to know what Magomedov has to reveal. Fans indeed showed excitement at the news of Magomedov stepping into the Octagon as a fighter.</span></p><p><strong>Watch This Story: </strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Who Is Internet Sensation Hasbulla?
