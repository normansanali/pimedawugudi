<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Probably Going to Be: Seven-Time PRCA World Champions Bull Riding SeasonComes to a Halt</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>All eyes are on the cowboys as they compete in the PBR Team Series. All levels of cowboy experience have converged on the PBR arena to demonstrate their skills. Also making his PBR Team Series debut this year was seven-time PRCA world champion Sage Kimzey, who did rather well in the preliminary rounds. After making his <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>PBR Team Series debut with the Carolina Cowboys</a>, the world champion went for an event in Cheyenne, Wyoming; though, he suffered an injury in the Semi-Finals of the bull riding competition shortly afterward.</p><p>The cowboy was taken to the hospital, where x-rays confirmed his shattered collarbone. This is also why Sage Kimzey has surgery scheduled for Wednesday. He’s on Injured Reserve for the time being, but he might return to action as soon as next week’s Stampede Days in Nashville. The cowboy’s injuries became a trending topic online, and he even commented on it.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>There’s still hope for the bull riding star</h2><p>The seven-time PRCA World Champion Bull Rider has been sidelined for&nbsp;the last two years due to injuries sustained while competing in PRCA rodeos. On July 28, 2023, during the semifinals of the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo, he was injured while riding Dakota Rodeo’s Devil’s Revenge. Kimzey was thrown off the bull at the 8-second mark, landing heavily on his left shoulder. Kimzey was then taken to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a fractured collarbone and scheduled for surgery later on. In explaining how he was hurt, the cowboy said, “I just landed weird on it.”</p><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>In an interview with ProRodeo</a>, the injured cowboy provided an update on his condition, stating, “It’s probably going to be six weeks. My plan is to get it all healed up.” As of August 2023, the cowboy is doubtful about returning to the PBR rodeo grounds for the Team Series, and there has been no word on whether or not he will compete in any future PRCA events. The seven-time world champion cowboy was the Carolina Cowboys’ first-ever draft choice in May 2023. This is obviously quite bad for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago0047352050h.jpg><p>The cowboy was also doing very well in the Team Series, so the Carolina squad will feel the effects of his absence while he recovers in the hospital.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>A classy return to the arena of PBR</h2><p>After a lengthy hiatus, the PRCA’s seven-time world champion decided to compete in the PBR’s Team Series. The Carolina Cowboys, who had drafted Sage Kimzey, were getting set to take on the Arizona Ridge Riders. The crowd was set to see the action as <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Kimzey was paired with Reba McEntire’s The Hammer</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago0047358691h.jpg><p>All attention was focused on the world champion bull rider as the arena’s metal gates opened. The bull gave it its all to try to buck off the cowboy, but it’s not easy to knock off a world champion. Kimzey took every attempt from the bull&nbsp;and didn’t make a single mistake until the 8-second buzzer. The judges gave him a perfect score of 90 because of his stunning performance, which sent the audience into a frenzy.</p><p><b>WATCH THIS STORY –&nbsp;</b><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><b>Resurfaced Footage Shows 24-Year-Old Rodeo Star’s Epic 90-Point Ride From 2022 PBR Team Series</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SsZKyon6fBtHnRqJuep12Xwq24jKugnaGenHqvsdasZKmqn5euo7jYZp6ooZ6cerW7jJucZquVq7KvedOipJ5loKewonnWqKmlnF2YtaK5z6Kmp6tdl8KtuIyroJ2hnpx6tLHArKanZZOkuqa%2FjK2mZpldna6twIyana2domK0r63RpbBmoZ6fwrPFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./me-and-ari-aster-are-due-a-good-scrap-talk-to-me-director-ready-to-throw-down-with-another-horror-maestro.html><span>←</span><span>Me and Ari Aster are due a good scrap: Talk to Me director ready to throw down with anot</span></a>
