Beer has been very vocal about her struggle with acne and skin concerns, and the two stars chose to collaborate on a skincare company. They launched Know Beauty in 2021, which differed from other skincare brands. Recently, though Beer left the brand. Here is what happened between Vanessa Hudgens and Madison Beer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vanessa-hudgens-and-madison-beer-39-s-friendship>Vanessa Hudgens And Madison Beer's Friendship</h2><p>Vanessa Hudgens and Madison Beer are certainly an unexpected pairing for a friendship.</p><p>Hudgens is a well-known actress who rose to fame after starring in the Disney film franchise High School Musical. Since then, Hudgens has branched out in her acting. She is the lead of the Netflix film series The Princess Switch, and she has also starred in productions such as Tick, Tick... Boom, Rent: Live, and most recently Downtown Owl. She has several upcoming projects in the works.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52674645.jpg><p>Madison Beer, on the other hand, is a singer. She entered the music industry in 2013 with her debut single 'Melodies.' She has released two albums: As She Pleases and Life Support. Her upcoming album Silence Between Songs is set to release in September 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudgens and Beer met through Hudgens's younger sister Stella</a>. Beer and Stella are good friends, so Beer would often see Hudgens.

Hudgens, on the other hand, was working hard to keep her youthful glow as she aged into her 30s.</p><p>Their mutual passion for skincare was the root of their friendship and inspired them to start working together.</p><h2 id=hudgens-and-beer-39-s-company-know-beauty>Hudgens And Beer's Company, Know Beauty</h2><p>Wanting to overcome their individual skin concerns, Vanessa Hudgens and Madison Beer chose to create their own skincare company. The celebrities wanted a more personal touch than what is typically found on the shelves, and they worked alongside dermatologist Karen Kagha.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Know Beauty differs from a lot of skincare companies due to its association with DNA analysis and the concept of personalized skincare.</p><p>Personalized skincare is a trend in the cosmetic industry that was particularly popular in 2021, which is when Know Beauty was launched. The idea is strong, as it not only provides information, but also theoretically a great skincare routine.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Customers are encouraged to use Know Beauty's DNA kit</a>, which they must purchase for not a low fee, and complete a short skin quiz. Know Beauty then uses the analytic techniques designed by Kagha to recommend specific products from their store.</p><p>Though the DNA kit is not required in order to purchase Know Beauty products, it is highly recommended by the brand.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Austin Butler Was Accused Of Cheating On Vanessa Hudgens Causing An End To Their Relationship, But Are The Rumors True?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the DNA analysis, Hudgens and Beer hoped that Know Beauty would provide "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an easier way to approach skin care</a>, something that allows you to know what is right for your personal skin, because it's different for everyone."</p><p>"Having that knowledge," Hudgens told Harper's Bazaar in reference to the DNA test, "is like having a weight lifted off of your back, to know that what you're using is actually going to work for you."</p><h2 id=why-madison-beer-quit-skincare-brand-know-beauty>Why Madison Beer Quit Skincare Brand Know Beauty</h2><p>Though the concept of personalized skincare was very popular in 2021, the trend has fallen away in recent years. Customers realized that a DNA sample is not really enough to determine exactly what their skin needs, and this is particular true for those with sensitive skin. Unfortunately for the trend, people with sensitive skin, either meaning reactive or acne prone, were the type of customers the trend was geared towards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the fall of personalized skincare, Know Beauty faced some issues. Despite highly marketing their brand across beauty magazines and websites, Vanessa Hudgens and Madison Beer were unable to truly get the brand off the ground.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/madison-beer-singing.jpg><p>Though the trend was no longer popular, this is still surprising due to the attachment of two celebrities. Celebrity skincare and cosmetic brands are all the rage. Stars such as <strong><a href=#>Selena Gomez</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Hailey Bieber</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Rihanna</a></strong> have found great success with their cosmetic brands.</p><p>In an interview with WWD, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudgens opened up about the struggle she was having with the brand</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hudgens "had been trying to get customers acquainted with the brand for a while, but it just wasn't translating like we thought it would. After a year, we knew we needed to switch gears and try something different."</p><p>"Trying to take over an entire skin care line is a bit ambitious," Hudgens continued. "Instead I decided to focus on something specific that could easily be slotted into a skin care routine--something we can be known for."</p><p>Now, Know Beauty only sells their Glacial Bay Clay Mask, and customers can even purchase it directly on Amazon.</p><p>With the reboot of the brand, Beer thought that it was best to take a step back from the brand. She wanted to focus solely on her music career, especially with her new album coming out in late 2023. Restarting the entirety of Know Beauty was going to be too much work for her to take on.</p><p>Fans can rest easy knowing that there was no feud between Madison Beer and Vanessa Hudgens. They are simply not working together anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGitmqaVqMCieceum6Cdnqh6rq3Doqqopl2Xsqa%2BjKyioqaTlr%2BmecKopKmZnq56rLrOsGSbnZGqwbp5xZ6snWWhqra1ecGuqqKmlajAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-khan-shares-the-latest-on-the-vacant-championship.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Khan Shares the Latest on the Vacant Championship</span></a>
