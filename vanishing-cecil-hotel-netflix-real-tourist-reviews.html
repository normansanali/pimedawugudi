"<strong>Needless to say there was not much sleep</strong> for my daughter and I, it takes a lot to freak me out but this place did me in. And I did not know the history of this hotel nor ever heard of it before I stayed there."</p><p id=e9opahMTSRI9 data-wc=17>2. "Lot of murder and crime here. Do not stay here. U will be disappointed and scared."</p><p id=eB4hO5dHg0UB data-wc=38>3. "The moment [the clerk] mentioned things I must agree on & sign before being handed the room key, such as: 'No drugs allowed in room or in the hotel', I thought to myself, 'You in danger girl!'."</p><p id=epYH4hEwHhCb data-wc=17>4. "My advice, pick somewhere else to stay for a little more money. This place is scary."</p><p id=ezsFKQYa5d4F data-wc=50>5. "<strong>As we make our trip down the hall things get scarier, the paint's peeling and there are people SCREAMING at one another</strong>… Our room DID have a bathroom which was a nice surprise but honestly it didn't make a bit of difference, because we were living a god**n nightmare."</p><p id=esh8uUwBkzsx data-wc=29>6.

Boasting 700 rooms and a grand marble lobby,<strong> the hotel was the place to be until the Great Depression hit </strong>and it became a meeting point for sex workers and criminals.</p><p id=ev5RIELa5bL- data-wc=30>The hotel has since become famous for its association with serial killers.
