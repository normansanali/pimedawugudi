That is all the more impressive once you learn <a href=#>Diesel came close to starring in another massively popular film franchise</a>.As a result of Diesel's massive success, his life has been changed in two main ways. First off, Diesel can now demand massive paychecks for the movies he stars in which has allowed him to accumulate a $225 million fortune as of this writing, according to celebritynetworth.com.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ranking The Guardians Of The Galaxy Cast By Net Worth</a></span>The other major side effect of Diesel's rise to fame is that there now is a lot of interest in his personal life. Most notably, there are a lot of people who are curious about the person who is Diesel's wife and the mother of his three children.Despite how famous Diesel is, most people know next to nothing about his longtime common-law wife Paloma Jimenez. A perfect example of that is most of Diesel's fans don't realize that Jimenez also reportedly has amassed an impressive fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-truth-about-vin-diesel-and-paloma-jimenez-s-relationship>The Truth About Vin Diesel And Paloma Jimenez's Relationship</h2><p>For anyone who wants to know everything they can about Paloma Jimenez and Vin Diesel's relationship, the first thing they will need to learn is that very little is known about the couple. The reason for that is Diesel has always been secretive about his wife and their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Vin Diesel Is So Secretive About His Wife</a></span></p><p>The perfect example of Diesel's secretive nature when it comes to his relationship with Jimenez is that fans don't actually know if they are married. In the past, there have been reports about why Diesel hasn't married Jimenez but the truth is that for all his fans know, the couple could have secretly walked down the aisle last week or a decade ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it isn't entirely clear if Diesel and Jimenez have tied the knot and not told anyone, observers can still call them husband and wife, at least legally speaking. After all, they have been living together for many years so they are common law married if nothing else.</p><p>On top of being together since 2007, Diesel and Jimenez have added to their family several times over the years. In 2008, the couple welcomed their daughter Hania into the world and then they had their son Vincent in 2010.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vin-diesel-paloma-jimenez-and-their-family.jpg><p>Five years later, the birth of the couple's last child to date garnered a lot of headlines. The reason for that is Diesel and Jimenez named their second daughter Pauline <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to pay tribute to their close friend Paul Walker</a> after he passed away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-vin-diesel-s-wife-s-net-worth>What Is Vin Diesel's Wife's Net Worth?</h2><p>As a result of everything that Vin Diesel has achieved, it makes sense that publications like Forbes and celebritynetworth.com have reported on how rich he is. On the other hand, it may surprise people that celebritynetworth.com has reported on Paloma Jimenez's fortune.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Vin Diesel Is So Secretive About His Wife</a></span></p><p>Thanks to reports, a fair amount is known about Jimenez's financial situation, assuming what has been written is accurate. Most notably, it is fascinating that according to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimenez is worth $5 million</a> which is very impressive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vin-diesel-and-paloma-jimenez-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the outside looking in, it is impossible to know how much Jimenez's fortune has been affected by the fact that she has been with Diesel for roughly 15 years. That said, it seems all but certain that Diesel has played a major role in Jimenez accumulating that money.</p><p>Even if Diesel and Jimenez have completely different accounts and he has never deposited any cash in hers, his fortune would still affect hers since he can contribute so much to family expenses.</p><p>Putting aside any conjecture about Diesel's role in Jimenez's financial situation, it seems clear that she has made a good amount of money over the years.</p><p>Before she met Diesel, Jimenez was busy building a career for herself. As usmagazine.com reported, Jimenez became a model and she was "represented by Los Angeles model agency Two Management".</p><p>Thanks to how photogenic Jimenez is and her reps, she was hired to appear in some major magazines and <a href=#>she represented brands like Coca-Cola, Pantene, and Honda</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If that wasn't impressive enough, celebritynetworth.com reported that Jimenez also had reps in Mexico to help her find work there. For that reason, it makes sense that Jimenez once graced the cover of the Mexican version of Maxim magazine.</p><p>While it would be a stretch to pretend like Jimenez became a supermodel, she still enjoyed a lot of success in that industry. There may not be any way for the public to know how much Jimenez's modeling career contributed to her accounts, but she likely made a lot of money considering the high-profile gigs she landed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGitoqZdmbamv8SlZLChlpp6sa3LqKSaZZqeuqa6xLNkp52kYsSwvtOhZJ2nXZu8s3nAZqOirpmjtHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gta-online-counterfeit-cash-factory-income-guide.html><span>←</span><span>GTA Online Counterfeit Cash Factory income guide (2023)</span></a>
