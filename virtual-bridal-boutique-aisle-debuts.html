Created by four bridal experts—co-presidents <strong>Shara Levy </strong>(lawyer-turned-unofficial wedding planner) and <strong>David Yassky</strong> (former bridal editor for WWD and fashion stylist), chief creative officer <strong>Deborah Moses</strong> (former bridal magazine editor-in-chief), and chief merchandising officer <strong>Mark Ingram</strong> (bridal atelier owner)—the site offers mostly past season styles (although some are current) and an almost immediate delivery turnaround. "We feel our girl has done her research with regards to the different bridal designers, knows what styles work for her and is comfortable with online shopping. <span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"></span>With the help of very specific and tailored content, sizing charts and zoom capabilities on each product page, we are confident our girls will feel informed and comfortable with their purchases," Levy told us. "In order to provide added assurance, <strong>we will offer return insurance for gowns which a girl may purchase in order to have the option to return. If she decides to keep her gown, the price of the return insurance is credited back to her account."</strong> Plus, all designers involved are donating a portion of each gown's profits to the charity of their choice. But our favorite feature comes courtesy of label Anna Maier-Ulla Maija, who has not only agreed to sell gowns on the site, but custom-make every design. All you need to do is fill in four key measurements for the style you want, and expect a custom-created gown to arrive in seven to ten days. Yassky adds, "Girls can expect 30% off of these dresses, but sales will be final as the dress is made to measure." And if you're buying a dress straight off the virtual rack, creative director Deborah Moses assures us they will provide <strong>"[lots of] advice on pairing dresses up with incredible jewelry, bed jackets, veils and shoes we are curating to help the members achieve a total look."</strong> So while they can't offer a champagne-sipping, decadent changing room experience of a brick and mortar boutique, the founders want to make sure the shopping trip is still a special one. <span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"></span>'There will be fascinating and very useful editorial content and as well tidbits from our fabulous roster of designers that will make shopping with us a very luxurious and unique experience," Ingram said. Sounds like the royal treatment to us!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGemnr%2B1wcClZJuqmZmurXnBqKytoaGqsm6tyKyjnmWUmq%2B2wNI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./true-crime-reporter-monica-zukas-wikipedia-biography-more-on-her-career-family-life.html><span>←</span><span>True Crime Reporter Monica Zukas Wikipedia &amp;amp; Biography More On Her Career &amp;amp; Family Life The Talk</span></a>
