You cannot keep Russia from China,” Kilmeade rebutted.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Vivek Ramaswamy chafed with Nikki Haley during the debate Wednesday, calling her corrupt and likening her to a fascist. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>Ramaswamy protested that there are “kinks in that relationship.”</p><p>Kilmeade then asked if he was comfortable with Russia taking more of Eastern Europe.</p><p>“We have no idea how Ukraine has spent $200 billion of our money. We’re forking over more taxpayer money,” Ramaswamy responded. “That’s corrupt.”</p><p>Since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has authorized <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some $113 billion in aid</a>, but not all of that has been delivered. President Biden is <a href=#>seeking more money</a> for the war-torn nation as the war nears the end of its second year.</p><p>Ramaswamy also disputed the characterization of Ukraine as a democracy.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Brian Kilmeade pressed Vive Ramaswamy on the implications of his Ukraine policy. <span class=credit>FOX News</span></figure><p>“You sound so naive!” Kilmeade shot back. “You just give up Ukraine and then in a few years, you’ll be criticizing Joe Biden for giving up Ukraine.”</p><p>“Brian, I think that if I called Nikki Haley naive, you guys would be having a conniption, let’s be honest about that,” Ramaswamy answered. “I actually understand what the heck I’m talking about here.”</p><p>Echoing his criticsm of support for Ukraine on the debate stage, Ramaswamy called for “this neocon wisdom to be relegated to the dustbin of history where it belongs.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The biotech entrepreneur has been a fierce critic of US interventionism. <span class=credit>AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“Well forget ‘neocon wisdom’. Nobody buys into that,” Kilmeade chided before adding sarcastically “Just give up Eastern Europe.”</p><p>“I think it’s a boneheaded foreign policy and I think the right answer is that we need to protect Americans,” Ramaswamy concluded.</p><p>Just prior to the interview with Ramaswamy, co-host&nbsp;Steve Doocy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">described the 38-year-old’s debate performance</a> as “embarrassing.”</p><p>“He just came in too hot once again. He got booed a number of times,” said Doocy, who awarded Ramaswamy a fourth-place finish in his personal debate rankings “just because he was there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmaW9fo7K4v46voK%2Bdm2K%2FornArK6apalisK2t0qGcrGWnnsGpecWor2amlazAbrTOrKtmp6aav266wKKtnmWloL%2Bitc2eZKyskaOwpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vicky-wow-bio-net-worth-height-boyfriend-and-career.html><span>←</span><span>Vicky Wow : Bio, Net Worth, Height, Boyfriend And Career</span></a>
