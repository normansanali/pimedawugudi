Haim made his breakthrough in Lucas (1986), which would be revealed years later as the actor's most traumatic role. Not all famous <a href=#>children survive the strains of Hollywood</a>, and Corey Haim was certainly not the first or last to be scarred by a childhood in the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Haim's overwhelming success as a critically-acclaimed, award-winning child actor, Haim did not make it out of child stardom unscathed. But Haim was always supported by his close friend and fellow actor Corey Feldman, who has bravely spoken out about the abuse both of them suffered as children in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=corey-haim-39-s-heartbreaking-story>Corey Haim's Heartbreaking Story</h2><p>According to Feldman, there is a huge problem in Hollywood that involves child stars being taken advantage of. In 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey Feldman's documentary debuted at a screening in Los Angeles</a>, and in it, Feldman named names of the men who allegedly sexually assaulted him and Corey Haim. According to Corey Feldman, Charlie <a href=#>Sheen assaulted Haim during the making of the 1986 film Lucas</a>.</p><p>It took Corey Feldman a lot to get his documentary to be viewed by the public, after no streaming services were interested in airing the documentary. The "Goonies" actor showed the documentary on his website, and as a result, <a href=#>Corey Feldman was in fear for his life</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Highest-Paid Child Star Angus T.Jones Has A Worth Of $20 Million Today But How Much Is His Home Worth?</a></span></p><p>Corey Feldman has provided a voice for his friend Corey Haim, who sadly passed away in 2010. The two Coreys were best friends for a very long time, their first movie together being The Lost Boys.</p><p>The pair went on to be in twelve movies together and even had their own show together called The Two Coreys.</p><p>In his final moments, Haim was with his mother, and told her that he didn't feel well. The Lost Boys actor was initially believed to have died of a drug overdose after it was well known that he had struggled with addiction for most of his adult life, but the truth is Corey Haim died of pneumonia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His death shook fans and devastated everyone who knew him, and was especially heartbreaking after rumors started to circulate about what the last years of his life were like, and about the abuse he suffered as a child.</p><h2 id=what-was-the-final-year-of-haim-39-s-life-like>What Was The Final Year Of Haim's Life Like?</h2><p>Corey Haim faded from fame. He was addicted to prescription drugs and despite visiting rehab multiple times, Corey kept relapsing.</p><p>Apparently, Haim was alone in adulthood and didn't have a lot of money, and even drifted away from Corey Feldman, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decided that [Feldman] and Haim should take a break from their friendship</a> for a year while Haim focused on his sobriety and recovery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Corey Haim will forever be missed, his story a reminder of the dark side of Hollywood and why Feldman's mission to be the voice of those affected by the dark side of Hollywood is so important.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Child Stars Who Tried Out Music But Weren't Successful</a></span></p><p>It seemed that Corey Haim was getting somewhat back on track during the final year of his life; in 2010 he was in a relationship with reality TV star Daisy de la Hoya. But what happened to her after Corey Haim's death?</p><h2 id=who-is-daisy-de-la-hoya>Who Is Daisy de la Hoya?</h2><p>Daisy de la Hoya is an actress, singer, and reality TV star best known as the runner-up contestant on the reality TV show Rock Of Love, which starred Bret Michaels, the lead singer from Poison, as women competed on the dating show to be his girlfriend.</p><p>Daisy de la Hoya made it to the final of Rock of Love's second season alongside Amber Lake, who won. VH1 gave Daisy her own reality show after Rock of Love called Daisy of Love in 2009, but the show only lasted one season and Daisy never stayed in a relationship with the winner. Instead, Daisy started dating Corey Haim in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Struggles Of Fame: The Pros And 4 Cons Of Being A Child Star In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>After Daisy of Love, de la Hoya did lots of reality TV shows as well as acting. In 2016, the Rock of Love contestant got sober from drugs and seems to be doing well.</p><p>After her reality TV stint, Daisy seems to keep things low-key. She can be found on social media but her accounts are private. According to her Instagram bio, Daisy advocates for animal rights and suicide prevention.</p><p>She can be found creating content on YouTube, and has a channel called "Just Another Stupid YouTube Channel" where she posts content about life, health, food, music and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite living a private life that focuses on her passions such as music, Daisy de la Hoya has done a couple of interviews in the last few months, including being a guest on Talk Of Love with Lacey Sculls where she spoke about some of her previous relationships.</p><p>Back in 2010, Daisy poured her heart out about Corey Haim, saying she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"would have liked a happy ending"</a>, so fans were overjoyed to hear from her and see that she appears to be doing well after all she's been through.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FOq5yyZZiWtq55xqKppZ6inrKvsIydmKKrqWKxpnnLmmShp6mWfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ufc-boxing-mma-news-watch-henry-cejudo-gives-graphic-warning-to-hasbulla-after-getting-assaulted-by-mini-khabib-in-hilarious-video.html><span>←</span><span>WATCH: Henry Cejudo Gives Graphic Warning to Hasbulla After Getting Assaultedby Mini Khabib i</span></a>
