As a matter of fact, it was his strides in activism that magnified his relevance in Nigerian politics.

Find out more about him as you scroll through.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full Name: </b>Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour</li><li><b>Nickname: </b>GRV</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Date of Birth: </b>March 8, 1983</li><li><b>Age: </b>40 years</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>Yoruba</li><li><b>Nationality: </b>Nigeria<b>&nbsp;</b></li><li><b>Sexual Orientation: </b>Straight</li><li><b>Religion: </b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status: </b>Married</li><li><b>Wife: </b>Ifeyinwa Aniebo Rhodes-Vivour</li><li><b>Parents: </b>Father – Olawale Rhodes-Vivour, Mother -Nkechi Rhodes-Vivour</li><li><b>Famous for: </b>Running for Lagos State Governor</li><li><b>Instagram: </b>@grvlagos</li><li><b>Twitter: </b>@GRVlagos</li></ul><h2><strong>Where Is GRV From, Is He Yoruba or Igbo?</strong></h2><p>Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour was born in Lagos to Barrister Olawale Rhodes-Vivour (father) who is Yoruba and Mrs. Nkechi Rhodes-Vivour (mother) who is from the Igbo ethnic group. To be precise, he was birthed in Lagos Island and grew up in Ikeja where he had his basic education. GRV had his primary and secondary education at Chrisland primary school and Chrisland secondary school respectively.</p><p>However, he left Chrisland in JSS3 and completed his senior secondary education at École Active Bilingue in Paris, France. Young GRV went on to study architecture at the University of Nottingham UK. After obtaining his Bachelor’s degree from the school he proceeded to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he bagged a Master’s degree in architecture. Gbadebo had another second Master’s degree in Research and Public Policy at the University of Lagos.</p><h2><strong>The LP Guber Candidate Is An Architect By Profession</strong></h2><p>Most of his supporters call him the architect of a new Lagos. Although the meaning is sought figuratively, in a literal context, GRV is an architect by profession. He also has a distinctive academic background to back it up; having bagged a bachelor’s degree in architecture and masters in the same field.</p><p>Having spearheaded crucial projects in architecture as well as laid his hands on different architectural courses, Gbadebo has proven his strength in the field in so many ways. While in the UK, he worked with Franklin Ellis Architects and upon his return to Nigeria he joined a leading architectural firm, Consultants Collaborative Partnership (CCP). He is the founder and director of Spatial Tectonics.</p><p>He is also a board member at Alhuda Construction Nigeria and Delta International Commercial City Ltd. He stands out for his high regard for perfection when it comes to designs and is known for being the brain behind many notable plans; in fact, some people describe him as the pioneer of modern design in Lagos. This is because his works depict consciousness of the dynamic nature of the average urban environment.</p><h2><strong>His Political Career Kicked Off In 2017</strong></h2><p>GRV had his first shot at politics when he ran for the Ikeja Local Government Area chairmanship under KOWA party in 2017. However, he lost to the candidate of the ruling party. He again contested for the Lagos West senatorial seat under the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019.</p><p>Gbadebo sought to unseat the incumbent, Solomon Olamilekan Adeola ‘Yayi’,&nbsp; whom he described as an absentee senator. He, however, lost as he came in second place at the polls. He took his grievances to court citing issues of electoral violence as reasons why there were irregularities in the results. However, he lost the case. In August 2022 he won the gubernatorial primaries of the Labour Party and became its flagbearer for the 2023 governorship elections.</p><h2><strong>Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour Is The Leader of An Environmental Activist Group&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Gbadebo Rodes Vivour is a political and environmental activist. He spearheads the activities of the Nigerians Against GMO group, an activist group against the prevalence of Genetically Modified Foods. Claims that genetically modified foods were not harmful to the human body were championed in 2016 by Monsanto, an American biotechnology corporation.</p><p>This caused the group led by the LP candidate to stage a peaceful protest to fight against environmental degradation. He heavily criticized the Minister of Agriculture, Akinwumi Adeshina, for consenting to the introduction of genetically modified foods in Nigeria.</p><p>Gbadebo championed a healthcare program on World Malaria Day to administer health checks for about 1 million people in Lagos who had gotten their permanent voters card. This was also a way of fostering determination among the public to participate in the elections.</p><h3><strong>Gbadebo Participated In The EndSARS Protest In 2020</strong></h3><p>GRV was part of the celebrities and influential people who were involved in the EndSARs protest, a movement against police brutality in Nigeria. The movement sought to see the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a department of the Nigerian Police notorious for incessant abuse of citizens.</p><p>During the protest, he also granted interviews to a few sources and lent his voice in solidarity with the movement. He also called for police reforms and maintained that citizens should not be abused by those meant to protect them. This singular act of his endeared him to the youths, most of whom are his supporters in the 2023 elections.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour’s Wife?</strong></h2><p>GRV is married to Dr. Ify Rhodes-Vivour (nee Aniebo). She is a 40-year-old molecular geneticist with a focus on malaria drugs. Ify Aniebo is the daughter of Augustine Aniebo, a former military administrator to Kogi state as well as Borno state.</p><p>Dr. Ify is a graduate of Queen Mary University of London, where she studied Medical Genetics. She then moved to the University of Nottingham, UK and had a second degree in Biomolecular Technology. All indications suggest that the couple met at Nottingham University where GRV also had his bachelor’s degree.</p><p>Dr. Ify has actively contributed to the fight against Malaria through various research means. In the course of earning her Ph.D., she did her research toward finding a cure for Malaria in Thailand and the Malaria Department at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge. Her work was presented at the 21st World Malaria Conference held in Mae Sot, Thailand.</p><p>She did the same at the Genome Conference in Cambridge. Ify Aniebo has a health blog where she discusses health issues faced in Africa. She is also the founder of Afroscientric, an initiative that aims at inspiring more women to join the science field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571qGmZqGjYrSjrcOemahlop28pbHSZq2irp%2Bqv26z0a9m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-andrea-valdiri-popular-columbian-model-getting-married-to-youtuber-boyfriend-felipe-saruma-2.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Andrea Valdiri?
