This was following him becoming close to her since she was 16 years old. The frontman of the alternative rock group The Neighbourhood, he actually started his career not as a musician – but instead as an actor.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>Rutherford’s first credits came in the Angelina Jolie-led rom-com Life or Something Like It, followed up by an appearance in the true crime flick Ted Bundy, and most curiously in Star Trek: Enterprise in the episode “Marauders”. These three roles came in 2002, nearly a decade before his music career began.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>In 2011 he released his first mixtape titled Truth Hurts, Truth Heals, before networking around California to start a band. Eventually forming The Neighbourhood, their first album — 2012’s I Love You — received middling reviews but it didn’t sway them from making music. Rutherford’s biggest hit did come off the album in “Sweater Weather”, which is the 36th most streamed song of all time on Spotify.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>The band has been on hiatus since Feb. 2022, but perhaps Rutherford will collaborate with his new girlfriend Eilish in a solo career move.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Rutherford is eleven years older than Eilish, and the age gap has made up a good portion of the public’s interest in the couple. Both being musicians, it’s not surprising they’re together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmopWowKZ50a6roZ2im7yzsIywn56qlWLGsMGMpKWor12Xtq24yJ5knqGcnsCpv4ynnLBlkqTGp77InqWdZZanvK57</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-deanna-moyer-trying-to-understand-what-happened-to-her.html><span>←</span><span>Where is Deanna Moyer?
