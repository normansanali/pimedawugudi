One of these moments occurred at the end of the episode “Watch ‘Em Ride Away,” when a tribute card appeared as the cowboys and ranch hands rode away, honoring someone important to the series family.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>With Yellowstone, death is something viewers had to get used to immediately, and tears have been shed more than once due to the loss of characters within the storyline. There have also been deaths of actors who graced the series with their talents, including Buster Welch, the iconic Texas Cowboy Hall of Famer, in June of 2022. Timothy Reynolds was the name on the tribute card at the end of last week’s episode, and we’ll explain who he was below.</p><h2 id=h-timothy-reynolds-connection-to-yellowstone data-injectable=false>Timothy Reynolds’ connection to Yellowstone</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tim Reynolds (@tsreynolds1955)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>Reynolds had a less “flashy” role than an actor or writer in the series, but he was as important as ever. Reynolds was an electrical technician in seasons one through four of the series before his untimely death in August 2022. Reynolds worked on several other projects within his 30 years of service in the industry, discovering his love of working on sets while in the finance industry.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Sharing <a href=#>behind-the-scenes</a> shots of&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;on his Instagram profile, Reynolds even posted a snap of Gabriel “Gator” Guilbeau cooking up some food for everyone working on the series. You could tell Reynolds was as much a member of the Yellowstone family as those who grace our screens each week.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What other shows and films did Reynolds work on?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tim Reynolds (@tsreynolds1955)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>Reynolds’ IMDb page also notes that he worked on several projects with which fans of&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;are familiar, including&nbsp;Wind River,&nbsp;Hereditary,&nbsp;Joe Bell, and&nbsp;The American West.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>As we said before, Reynolds’ career spanned 30 years, and it appears that his first job was a television movie titled&nbsp;Not in This Town.
