Some speculate that only his heart was buried in Essex.</p><p dir=ltr>William the Conqueror claimed Christian control over the English lands that he invaded on behalf of Pope Alexander II (via <a href=#>Christianity.com</a>).

Apparently, his corpse exploded from an effort to shove his body into too small of a coffin, and the church was left with a pungent smell as a result. Historians believe this unfortunate turn of events allowed for looting and desecrating of the remains which might have led to stricter burial practices and/or guidelines (via <a href=#>Historic UK</a>).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j2poa2tnZMSpxYyrprKZnKh6r7HVnqlmoJGrsm67z56lZpuRqLimwNJmm66qmaO0brLUp5yrmZyofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-won-survivor-2022-spoilers-revealed-from-season-42-finale.html><span>←</span><span>Who Won 'Survivor' 2022?
