I mean if that wasn’t subliminal messages, I don’t know what was.”</p><p>Chanel didn’t back down. “It was subliminal messages, definitely,” she said. In a confessional interview, Chanel threw more shade: “Nothing… That was the best gift I could have given her.”</p><p>In a previous episode, the two castmates hugged it out at a party as a gesture of reconciliation. At the time, many fans believed the women had reached an understanding. The recent clip, however, tells a different story, as their lingering emotions rise to the surface.</p><p>The hatchet is officially unburied.</p><p><a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Dubai</strong> </a>airs Wednesday nights at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5iuerW0yKeerGWnmr%2BmedGomqSxXay2tbSMnJirp5yeu6Z50p6poKGfZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jazze-pha-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jazze Pha Dating Now</span></a>
