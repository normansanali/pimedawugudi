As of now, the event is being treated as a live in-person event without a televised distribution.</p><p>The advertised roster for the WWE Superstar Spectacle includes a lineup of prominent WWE Superstars. These include Seth Rollins, Rhea Ripley, John Cena, Sami Zayn, Kevin Owens, WWE Intercontinental Champion GUNTHER, Jinder Mahal, Veer, Sanga, Drew McIntyre, Becky Lynch, Natalya, Matt Riddle, Ludwig Kaiser, and Odyssey Jones.</p><p>The context of the WWE’s approach to the Indian market is significant. The company previously produced a TV special titled The Superstar Spectacular, tailored for the Indian audience and released on Republic Day in January 2021. In terms of live events, WWE had initially planned to hold a SmackDown brand house show in India in January 2022. However, the event was postponed due to the merging of television broadcast companies Sony and Zee, with Sony Sports Network serving as WWE’s broadcast partner in India.</p><p>What do you think about the decision to have the WWE Superstar Spectacle in Hyderabad, India as a live event rather than a televised broadcast?
