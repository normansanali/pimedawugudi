However, Vladimir Demikhov was actually blazing a genuine path of scientific inquiry, not <a href=#>science fiction</a>, which he called "transplantology," or the study of organ transplants.</p><p>In an article for <a href=#>The Annals of Thoracic Surgery</a>, Dr. Harris Schumacker lauds Demikhov as being the first person to "transplant an auxillary heart into the thorax of a warm-blooded animal, first to replace the heart with a homograft organ, first to carry out a pulmonary transplantation, and first to perform a complete heart and lung replacement." Even in the case of the two-headed dogs, there was an actual point to them, as Demikhov explained in the Life article: His tests revealed that the failure lies with the transplanted part, so a woman who was bothering him for a leg transplant, for instance, could now receive one with minimal risk: "The main problem will be joining the nerves so the woman can control her movements... But I am sure we can lick that problem too."&nbsp;</p><p>While attaching human heads to new bodies still seems out of reach, according to <a href=#>Popular Science</a>, the fact that we can take a beating heart and put it inside another person's body would have struck an early twentieth century scientist as fanciful. Now, it's perfectly possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkXFna25frry2wsRmp6unkpavrcWMoZyaqpRirqO71K1kraCVYsCktcSnq6KrpGLEqbuMnKmemaSasW6tjK2uqGWYmq6lscNmm6ifXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-macaulay-culkin-know-about-his-brothers-and-sisters-career.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Macaulay Culkin?
